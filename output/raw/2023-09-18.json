A maintainer's responsibility is to identify the relevant owners and ensure there's an understanding when it comes to code review.\n+\n+\n+### Inactivity\n+\n+There are no expectations around activity once someone becomes a core contributor or maintainer. Inactive core contributors or maintainers may have voting rights removed; however, will always retain their status. A core contributor or maintainer may request their voting rights back upon sufficient activity.\n+\n+\n+## Current Members\n+\n+Members are listed in alphabetical order. Members are free to use the full name, GitHub handle, or any other nickname they wish to be addressed. Members are free to disclose their gender.\n+\n+### Lead team\n+\n+- [Emanuele Stoppa @ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)\n+\n+### Core Contributors team\n+\n+\n+### Maintainers team\n+\n+",

Details of the discussion - for example, those who objected to the nomination - will not be disclosed.\n+\n+### Maintainer\n+\n+Maintainers are those with a history of consistent contributions, including but not limited to pull requests, project management, or support.

This process is informal, and inclusion could result from substantial contributions or delegation by other members. A maintainer's responsibility is to identify the relevant owners and ensure there's an understanding when it comes to code review.\n+\n+\n+### Inactivity\n+\n+There are no expectations around activity once someone becomes a core contributor or maintainer. Inactive core contributors or maintainers may have voting rights removed; however, will always retain their status. A core contributor or maintainer may request their voting rights back upon sufficient activity.",

Eventually, we introduced an emeritus system that IMO has been extremely helpful in distinguishing who is an active contributor vs. who once was but is not longer active.\r\n\r\nThe Emeritus system also helps ensure a more secure environment, since inactive accounts don't have push permissions, while still allowing for recognition and an easy way to start working again (simply ask to be re-added to the project from emeritus status, and you will be).\r\n\r\nTo be in good conscience, I feel obligated to at least leave a comment urging you to consider a way to build-in a system to step-down or off-board people who are inactive after having worked in such a system without an escape hatch like Emeritus for so long.",

An individual becomes a [core contributor](#core-contributor) if:\n+- receive at least a positive vote from a [lead](#lead);\n+- more than 70% of positive votes across the members of the Core contributors team;\n+\n+A core contributor can be self-nominated.

This document includes the contributor model, code review, merging, and the consequences and process for Code of Conduct violations.\n+\n+## Member Roles\n+\n+All members must follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Consequences for member violations are detailed in [Moderation](#moderation).\n+\n+### Lead\n+\n+Leads are the owners of the organisation.\n+\n+Leads have additional privileges over core contributors. Leads control and maintain sensitive project assets and act as tiebreakers in the event of disagreements.\n+\n+These assets and responsibilities are but are not limited to:\n+- Access to social accounts\n+- Administration privileges of the [Biome Discord server][discord]\n+- Administration privileges of the [Biome GitHub org][gh-org]\n+- Website accesses (hosting platform, domain name, etc.)\n+- Ability to vote for new leads\n+- Onboard new [core contributors](#core-contributor) and new leads;\n+- Takes part in [project decisions](#project-direction-and-planning)\n+\n+The ownership of assets is only sometimes evenly distributed among all the leads.\n+\n+### Core Contributor\n+\n+Core Contributors are outstanding [maintainers](#maintainer), ambassadors of Biome organisation and lead by example the community.\n+\n+- Push access to the [Biome GitHub org][gh-org], this includes all repositories\n+- `Core contributor` status on the [Biome Discord server][discord]\n+- Takes part in [project decisions](#project-direction-and-planning)\n+- Ability to [vote](#maintainer-nomination) on new maintainers and [vote](#core-contributor-nomination) on new core contributors\n+- Onboard new [maintainers](#maintainer)\n+\n+#### Core contributor nomination\n+\n+Core contributors may either be nominated by another, [Core contributor](#core-contributor), or [lead](#lead).\n+\n+When nominating a core contributor, the person has to create a new thread in the `#core-contributors` channel with a significant explanation of why the person should join as [core contributor](#core-contributor).\n+\n+`#core-contributors` is a private channel available only to people who have the `Core contributor` role.\n+\n+The voting period will follow the [voting rules](#voting-rules). An individual becomes a [core contributor](#core-contributor) if:\n+- receive at least a positive vote from a [lead](#lead);\n+- more than 70% of positive votes across the members of the Core contributors team;\n+\n+A core contributor can be self-nominated. They will have to message a [lead maintainer](#lead) privately and present a case. Then, the lead can:\n+- reject the nomination in place, provide reasons why and possibly some suggestions for the future;\n+- initiate a voting session among the core contributors;\n+\n+Upon termination of a nomination, the thread will be deleted, and a [lead](#lead) will reach out to the nominee and ask them if they want to accept the title.\n+\n+In the event of a rejection, the nominated person will be privately given the requirements they have yet to meet. Details of the discussion - for example, those who objected to the nomination - will not be disclosed.\n+\n+### Maintainer\n+\n+Maintainers are those with a history of consistent contributions, including but not limited to pull requests, project management, or support. These privileges include:\n+\n+- Push access to some of the repositories of the [Biome GitHub org][gh-org]\n+- `Maintainer` status on the [Biome Discord server][discord]\n+- Ability to [vote](#voting) on project decisions\n+- Ability to [vote](#maintainer-nomination) on new maintainers\n+\n+#### Maintainer nomination\n+\n+Maintainers may either be nominated by another [maintainer](#maintainer), [Core contributor](#core-contributor), [lead](#lead).\n+\n+When nominating a new maintainer, the person has to create a new thread in the `#maintainers` channel, provide a link to the history of the person's contributions to the project and a brief explanation of why the person should join as [maintainer](#maintainer).\n+\n+`#maintainers` is a private channel available only to people who have the `maintainer` role.\n+\n+The voting period will follow the [voting rules](#voting-rules). An individual becomes a [maintainer](#maintainer) if:\n+- reaches more than 50% of positive votes among the people who have voting rights;\n+- if the voting session ends with 50%, the Lead maintainers will take the decision;\n+\n+A maintainer can be self-nominated. They will have to message a [lead maintainer](#lead) privately with links to their contributions to the project. Then, the lead can:\n+- reject the nomination in place, provide reasons why and possibly some suggestions for the future;\n+- initiate a voting session among the maintainers;\n+\n+Upon termination of a nomination, the thread will be deleted, and a [core contributor](#core-contributor) will reach out to the nominee and ask them if they want to accept the title.\n+\n+In the event of a rejection, the nominated person will be privately given the requirements they have not met. Details of the discussion, such as the names of those who objected the nomination, will not be disclosed.\n+\n+\n+### Voting Rules\n+\n+- Members may abstain from a vote.\n+- Members who do not vote within seven days will automatically abstain.\n+- Leads may reduce the seven days automatic abstain for urgent decisions.\n+- Leads reserve the right to veto approval with a publicly disclosed reason.\n+\n+### Ownership\n+\n+One or more people can own certain parts of the codebase. This process is informal, and inclusion could result from substantial contributions or delegation by other members. A maintainer's responsibility is to identify the relevant owners and ensure there's an understanding when it comes to code review.\n+\n+\n+### Inactivity\n+\n+There are no expectations around activity once someone becomes a core contributor or maintainer. Inactive core contributors or maintainers may have voting rights removed; however, will always retain their status. A core contributor or maintainer may request their voting rights back upon sufficient activity.\n+\n+\n+## Current Members\n+\n+Members are listed in alphabetical order. Members are free to use the full name, GitHub handle, or any other nickname they wish to be addressed. Members are free to disclose their gender.\n+\n+### Lead team\n+\n+- [Emanuele Stoppa @ematipico](https://github.com/ematipico)\n+\n+### Core Contributors team\n+\n+\n+### Maintainers team\n+\n+\n+## Project direction and planning\n+\n+Project direction and planning is a shared responsibility amongst members. Core contributors are responsible for dictating high-level goals and the project scope that should be adhered to.\n+\n+### Roadmap\n+\n+Leads may create a roadmap document to share with the community once the core contributors have set the project's goals.\n+\n+Roadmaps don't provide dates or deadlines; they only reflect what the core contributors decide to work on and how to spend the resources.\n+\n+The span of a roadmap should cover six months, but it might vary.\n+\n+## Code review\n+We have a reasonably liberal approach to code review and merging. We value quick iteration and low development friction, which comes with great responsibility. Reverting code is easy, so landing code should be just as easy. Because of this, Biome will have discrete releases rather than rolling releases that are automatically published.\n+\n+- If you own a particular area, you can merge it without any review despite PR size.\n+- If there are comments or suggestions after a PR is merged after the fact, allow yourself time to address them in a follow-up PR. If you don't respond in a reasonable timeframe, then create an issue to track.\n+- Ensure that the PR summary is detailed, listing steps you took to verify the rationale and relevant issues and people involved in any prior discussion.\n+- Ensure that PRs contain adequate tests and code comments for a future contributor to derive intent and modify your code safely.\n+- You are welcome to the repos for your WIP branches. Branches that have more than four months of inactivity will be pruned.\n+- If you add a new feature, ensure it has been discussed or approved on GitHub or Discord.\n+- If necessary, identify potential owners for PR review and approval.\n+- All code must go through Pull Requests (PR) and pass status checks before being merged. If a PR is merged that breaks `main` due to the branch not being up-to-date, then it should either be reverted or a quick fix merged as a separate PR.\n+- If a PR is against code you have previously committed and is either small changes, bug fixes, or refactors, then you're free to merge it without any review. However, if you need more confidence in your changes, you can wait for approval from another maintainer or core contributor.\n+\n+## Moderation\n+\n+Outlined below is the process for Code of Conduct violation reviews.\n+\n+### Reporting\n+\n+Anyone may report a violation. Violations can be reported in the following ways:\n+\n+- In private, via <biomejs@googlegroups.com> which is listed in the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All core contributors monitor this email address.\n+- In private, via email to one or more core contributors.\n+- In private, via direct message to a core contributor on [Discord server][discord].\n+- In public, via a GitHub comment (mentioning `@biomejs/core-contributors`).\n+- In public, via the project [Discord server][discord].\n+\n+### Who gets involved?\n+\n+Each report will be assigned reviewers. These will initially be all project [core contributors](#core-contributors-team).\n+\n+In the event of any conflict of interest - e.g. core contributors who are personally connected to a situation they must immediately recuse themselves.\n+\n+At the reporter's request and if deemed appropriate by the reviewers, another neutral third party may be involved in the review and decision process.\n+\n+### Review\n+\n+If a report doesn't contain enough information, the reviewers will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.\n+\n+The reviewers will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:\n+\n+- What happened.\n+- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.\n+- Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.\n+- Whether this is an ongoing situation.\n+\n+The reviewers should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if they have not decided within a week, they will inform the parties of the planned date.\n+\n+### Resolution\n+\n+The reviewers will determine responses based on the information gathered and the potential consequences. It may include:\n+\n+- taking no further action\n+- issuing a reprimand (private or public)\n+- asking for an apology (private or public)\n+- permanent ban from the GitHub org and Discord server\n+- revoked contributor or moderator status",

        "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nI use Luxon for nodevu, which is a module to get data about Node.js versions. I run nightly builds of static data for the module, and they started failing a bit ago. I recently had a user reach out saying they'd realized there was an issue with Luxon. Upon pretty basic investigation, it seems there's an issue between Luxon 3.3.0 and 3.4.0 where behavior around milliseconds seemingly changed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nPlease share a minimal code example that triggers the problem:\r\nI wasn't able to narrow down _what_ in Luxon is triggering this, but I did create a minimal reproduction to trigger the issue with nodevu. I apologize for not being able to dig in more and make something more minimal, but I'm currently OOO and am limited on time to work on code.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/bnb/luxon-breaking-minor.git\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will output nodevu output that can safely be ignored _and_ the error + stack trace.\r\n\r\n**Actual vs Expected behavior**\r\nMilliseconds management should not change in minors.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: [e.g. iOS] macOS\r\n- Browser [e.g. Chrome 84, safari 14.0] N/A\r\n- Luxon version [e.g. 1.25.0] 3.4.0\r\n- Your timezone [e.g. \"America/New_York\"] America/New_York\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "@ovflowd the reason I initially chose Undici was because Node's fetch wasn't available in LTS release lines. I believe this is still true?\r\n\r\nAFAIK, custom fetch _shouldn't_ die because of Undici, since is should completely go around Undici. That sounds like a bug - if that's true, I'd prefer to fix that over cutting support for some LTS versions of Node.js 🤔 ",
