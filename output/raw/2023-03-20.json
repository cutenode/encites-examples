        "body": "Commenting as I'm reading, but wanted to get ideas out:\r\n\r\nThis is cool and I'm happy to see this change. Overall I think this will be a healthy change for the project. IMO this will dramatically reduce the barrier to people feeling like they belong, which I think is likely a good move for the project and how it's rather uniquely governed.\r\n\r\n> I've done that kind of outreach in the past and it has never yielded results. People always want to stay on the TSC, typically because \"Node.js TSC member\" helps people's careers and conference-speaking prospects and other things. By allowing them to keep the title, this change will (hopefully) make the process easier. (I have already had one person tell me they would probably move to the \"regular member\" status if this change goes through, which is certainly an indication that this change might make the whole role-change less challenging for everyone.)\r\n\r\nI'll 100% +1 this - IMO this is a result of the extremely relaxed membership approach that io.js took, which defined the culture of participation in Node.js to this day. I had a very similar experience as the CommComm chair - people would just say yes they wanted to be a member then never show up again. Every time I asked they were just about to be able to contribute again. I've definitely ended up in this position myself a few times - though in those situations in the past year or two, I've tried to recognize it and step back to evaluate if my response is the most accurate one I can give. \r\n\r\nAdding Emeritus with a low barrier in CommComm did help with this, and I'm guessing the model proposed here is going to be even more helpful.\r\n\r\n> And to preempt a potential question: \"Won't that make the title of 'TSC member' less valuable or even worthless?\" My answer is that would be a feature and not a bug. If this change makes TSC (voting) member less of a symbol of status or power to be pursued, and more of a duty, volunteer function, or perhaps even a calling, that would be good.\r\n\r\nThis is a good take and I'm happy to hear it.\r\n\r\nIn general, I have been worried about stagnation in the project's leadership. We used to see a lot more faces cycling through higher leadership positions, but that has dramatically slowed. I'm hopeful that this is a healthy step that will enable more people grow into leadership in the project.",

This milestone is the perfect\n+opportunity to celebrate and reflect on our journey so far, and to share what we’ve learned along\n+the way.\n+\n+We would not be here today without everyone who has dedicated their time and effort to contribute to\n+the project. Although source code commits are always the most visible contributions, we also have to\n+acknowledge the effort of folks who report bugs, maintain userland modules, provide documentation\n+and translations, and participate in the Electron community across cyberspace.\n+Every contribution is invaluable to us as maintainers.\n+\n+**Before we continue with the rest of the blog post: thank you. ❤️**\n+\n+## How did we get here?\n+\n+**Atom Shell** was built as the backbone for GitHub’s [Atom editor](https://atom.io/), which launched in\n+public beta in April 2014. It was built from the ground-up as an alternative to the web-based\n+desktop frameworks available at the time (node-webkit and Chrome Embedded Framework). It had a\n+killer feature: embedding Node.js and Chromium to provide a powerful desktop runtime for web\n+technologies.\n+\n+Within a year, Atom Shell began seeing immense growth in capabilities and popularity.\n+Large companies, startups, and individual developers alike had started building apps with it\n+(some early adopters include [Slack](https://slack.com), [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com), and\n+[WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io)), and the project was aptly renamed to **Electron**.\n+\n+From then on, Electron hit the ground running and never stopped. Here’s a look at our weekly\n+download count over time, courtesy of [npmtrends.com](https://npmtrends.com/electron):\n+\n+![Electron weekly downloads graph over time](/assets/img/weekly-download-graph.png)\n+\n+Electron v1.0 was released in 2016, promising increased API stability and better docs and tooling.\n+Electron v2.0 released in 2018 and introduced semantic versioning, making it easier for Electron\n+developers to keep track of the release cycle.\n+\n+By Electron v6.0, we shifted to a regular 12-week major release cadence to match Chromium’s. This\n+decision was a change in mentality for the project, bringing “having the most up-to-date Chromium\n+version” from a nice-to-have to a priority. This has reduced the amount of tech debt between\n+upgrades, making it easier for us to keep Electron updated and secure.\n+\n+Since then, we’ve been a well-oiled machine, releasing a new Electron version on the same day as\n+every Chromium stable. By the time Chromium sped up their release schedule to 4 weeks in 2021,\n+we were able to shrug our shoulders and increase our release cadence to 8 weeks accordingly.\n+\n+We’re now on Electron v23.0 (and counting), and are still dedicated to building the best runtime for\n+building cross-platform desktop applications. Even with the boom in JavaScript developer tools in\n+recent years, Electron has remained a stable, battle-tested stalwart of the desktop app framework\n+landscape. Electron apps are ubiquitous nowadays: you can program with Visual Studio Code, design\n+with Figma, communicate with Slack, and take notes with Notion (amongst many other use cases).\n+We’re incredibly proud of this achievement and grateful to everyone who has made it possible.",

This milestone is the perfect\n+opportunity to celebrate and reflect on our journey so far, and to share what we’ve learned along\n+the way.\n+\n+We would not be here today without everyone who has dedicated their time and effort to contribute to\n+the project. Although source code commits are always the most visible contributions, we also have to\n+acknowledge the effort of folks who report bugs, maintain userland modules, provide documentation\n+and translations, and participate in the Electron community across cyberspace.\n+Every contribution is invaluable to us as maintainers.\n+\n+**Before we continue with the rest of the blog post: thank you. ❤️**\n+\n+## How did we get here?\n+\n+**Atom Shell** was built as the backbone for GitHub’s [Atom editor](https://atom.io/), which launched in\n+public beta in April 2014. It was built from the ground-up as an alternative to the web-based\n+desktop frameworks available at the time (node-webkit and Chrome Embedded Framework). It had a\n+killer feature: embedding Node.js and Chromium to provide a powerful desktop runtime for web\n+technologies.\n+\n+Within a year, Atom Shell began seeing immense growth in capabilities and popularity.\n+Large companies, startups, and individual developers alike had started building apps with it\n+(some early adopters include [Slack](https://slack.com), [GitKraken](https://gitkraken.com), and\n+[WebTorrent](https://webtorrent.io)), and the project was aptly renamed to **Electron**.\n+\n+From then on, Electron hit the ground running and never stopped. Here’s a look at our weekly\n+download count over time, courtesy of [npmtrends.com](https://npmtrends.com/electron):\n+\n+![Electron weekly downloads graph over time](/assets/img/weekly-download-graph.png)\n+\n+Electron v1.0 was released in 2016, promising increased API stability and better docs and tooling.\n+Electron v2.0 released in 2018 and introduced semantic versioning, making it easier for Electron",

I think in general the idea behind how it's currently set up should be retained (have a wide variety of examples that are allowed, allow platform-specific examples even if those platforms are paid), but agree it needs love. I think generally it just needs people to write examples. I explicitly didn't write examples because I didn't want it to be yet another thing that only I was driving, which has been A Thing in the past. I'd very much love it if other people were interested and wanted to take charge - I'd also be happy to be a contributor of examples.\r\n\r\nSome notes on what I think could help dramatically improve its current state:\r\n- use npm workspaces to be able to run all tests at once and allow more granular test running\r\n- fix CI to actually scope them correctly ([paths works](https://twitter.com/joshmgross/status/1603218558032420866?s=20)! this is what stopped me from working on it more!)\r\n- do outreach to other projects to try to partner with them to get some examples in",

        "body": "Hi @nodejs/collaborators. In the [last TC39 meeting](https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-01/jan-31.md#problems-with-import-assertions-for-module-types-and-a-possible-general-solution–downgrade-to-stage-2), the committee voted to downgrade the [Import Assertions proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions) from Stage 3 to Stage 2. This is the proposal that permits syntax like `import data from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' }` that used to live behind `--experimental-json-modules` and was unflagged in January 2022. Because of the possible change in direction of the import assertions syntax, the Node TSC is considering requiring the flag once again for this syntax starting in Node 20.0.0 this April; unless we can get some assurance from TC39 that the syntax won’t change.\r\n\r\nHow do you feel about the potential reintroduction of this flag? How disruptive would restoring the flag be, and how disruptive would potential future import assertions syntax changes be?\r\n\r\n(Locking this thread just to collaborators, so that we can have a discussion without involving TC39 members. Once this thread has run its course I’ll post something on a TC39 repo.) cc @nodejs/modules @nodejs/loaders ",

        "body": "> While I agree with the spec compliance sentiment in this discussion, I just wanted to make sure we're aware of the potential disruption to the ecosystem of user packages since all it takes is a single transitive dependency relying on import assertions and we have an enormous potential to get some very frustrated users (many of them confused about why they can't upgrade to node20 without breaking their tools and without a clue on how to fix it).\r\n>\r\n> Also, I believe I am missing an important context in this discussion on why the experimental flag was removed while the feature was still on stage 3 in the first place.\r\n>\r\n> Sorry I'm not the best at playing devil's advocate but I feel like the current discussion is too one sided at the moment so I'd love to see a few more arguments from the folks that want to reintroduce the flag since in my point of view this has the potential to introduce a lot of unnecessary churn to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThis is a reasonable thing to flag, @ruyadorno <3\r\n\r\nIMO the tradeoff here is \"reflag now and break a small number of packages that are early adopters\" vs. \"have syntax that will almost certainly be broken, and have to force the ecosystem to cope with a more aggressive breaking change down the road\". For me, knowing how much pain _not_ ripping the band-aid off causes the ecosystem, it's preferable to break ASAP rather than letting a lot of debt build up and have a bigger, more impactful, more challenging break down the road.",

In the [last TC39 meeting](https://github.com/tc39/notes/blob/main/meetings/2023-01/jan-31.md#problems-with-import-assertions-for-module-types-and-a-possible-general-solution–downgrade-to-stage-2), the committee voted to downgrade the [Import Assertions proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-assertions) from Stage 3 to Stage 2. This is the proposal that permits syntax like `import data from './data.json' assert { type: 'json' }` that used to live behind `--experimental-json-modules` and was unflagged in January 2022. Because of the possible change in direction of the import assertions syntax, the Node TSC is considering requiring the flag once again for this syntax starting in Node 20.0.0 this April; unless we can get some assurance from TC39 that the syntax won’t change.\r\n\r\nHow do you feel about the potential reintroduction of this flag? How disruptive would restoring the flag be, and how disruptive would potential future import assertions syntax changes be?\r\n\r\n(Locking this thread just to collaborators, so that we can have a discussion without involving TC39 members. Once this thread has run its course I’ll post something on a TC39 repo.) cc @nodejs/modules @nodejs/loaders ",

This remediation along with using least privilege principle for each action in the workflow, makes it harder for a possible action hijacker to have high access to your repository.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gabriela Gutierrez <gabigutierrez@google.com>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\nCommit message formatting guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

This is a draft until we get them and I retest the flow via [nodejs/node-auto-test](https://github.com/nodejs/node-auto-test/actions/runs/4091649869) again once we get the credentials and set them as either organization or repository secrets.\r\n\r\n- v19.x lands clean\r\n- v18.x I will open backport PR for the WPTRunner and make target\r\n- v16.x I will open backport PR for the WPTRunner and make target\r\n\r\nThe workflow file gracefully handles cases when the backport was not done yet and the way the Node.js versions are determined requires no upkeep.\r\n\r\nCloses #46443",

        "body": "At the end of April, Node.js v14 will be EOL and v16 will be the minimum supported version of Node.js. [unidici-fetch](https://github.com/nodejs/undici#undicifetchinput-init-promise) fully supports Node.js v16 (I believe some features are missing from v14 that undici-fetch uses). Undici is an official project _under_ the Node.js project, so it will be very will supported within Node.js, and problems will get resolved rapidly as they come up. Undici also generally has a pretty hardcore focus on performance, which will very likely benefit us here.\r\n\r\nundici-fetch is directly included in Node.js v18 as Node.js's official fetch implementation, meaning that _next year_ a third-party dependency could be _entirely_ dropped since Node.js will support fetch directly, natively, on all supported release lines.\r\n\r\nOutside of adopting undici-fetch, I do +1 allowing users to bring their own fetch implementation if they don't want to use the one we provide. There is already support for a [Custom HTTP Client](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node/custom-http-clients-node) (thank you @beebzz for pointing this out!), so I'm not sure how different \"custom fetch\" (request in the OP) and \"custom HTTP client\" are in practice.",

Add a PREAMBLE file containing only the first portion of CoC\r\n  - This pull request copies the first portion, and later applies changes only required to make sense in this context. (Removing some links and adding context to CoC modifications) \r\n2. Add a patching script (a different pull request)\r\n  - Update the `base_url` on the patch script with the URL of the SHA commit from this pull request to use it as a baseline. \r\n  - Remove the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n  - Generate an initial patching file required to have the current version of CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with minimal changes.\r\n  - Push it to the patching script.\r\n  \r\nCo-authored by @joesepi \r\n\r\n",

Add a PREAMBLE file containing only the first portion of CoC\r\n  - This pull request copies the first portion, and later applies changes only required to make sense in this context. (Removing some links and adding context to CoC modifications) \r\n2. Add a patching script (a different pull request)\r\n  - Update the `base_url` on the patch script with the URL of the SHA commit from this pull request to use it as a baseline. \r\n  - Remove the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\r\n  - Generate an initial patching file required to have the current version of CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md with minimal changes.\r\n  - Push it to the patching script.\r\n  \r\nCo-authored by @joesepi \r\n\r\n",

The remaining scripts will be ported together with their respective Layouts.\r\n    * [x] Migrating the Handlebars layouts (templates) into JSX/React Components\r\n      * Around **100%** of the layouts are migrated and ready.\r\n    * [x] Re-linking the existing styles (Sass) to the new JSX Components\r\n* [x] Update the Nextra Theme with:\r\n    * [x] Understanding the current Frontmatter\r\n    * [x] Linking the correct layouts based on Frontmatter\r\n    * [x] Update the `theme.tsx` to use the correct layout\r\n* [x] Final underlying mechanisms such as:\r\n    * [x] Migrating the pure JavaScript scripts (public/static/scripts) to be part of JSX\r\n      * I've decided to do this outside this PR, as it would be changing the content, and this can be done as they will be discarded in the future anyways.\r\n    * [x] Remove old/legacy scripts/\r\n    * [x] Update other scripts, such as the release-post script\r\n    * [x] Add the meta/header/metadata tags with Nextra\r\n    * [x] Implement the RSS feed feature\r\n    * [x] Implement the Sitemap feature\r\n    * [x] i18n functionality\r\n      * [x] Port all translations from their JSON files to the `i18n/locales/{localeCode}.json`\r\n    * [x] Node.js version & release schedule metadata\r\n* [x] Preparing the PR to its readiness for review\r\n    * [x] Check the Markdown files are OK and working with the current MDX engine\r\n    * [x] Update the tests and final preparations\r\n    * [x] Check if everything is working, such as build, links, and other things\r\n    * [x] Re-enable build on CI\r\n* [x] PR ready to be reviewed\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n### Migration of Structure\r\n\r\nA few directories have been changed to accommodate the new Next.js folder structure. Notably, these are the significant changes:\r\n\r\n- Some Handlebar utilities became React Components under `components`\r\n- Sass files (SCSS) were moved to `styles`\r\n- Pages were moved from `locale/` to `pages/`\r\n- Static Files were moved from `static/` to `public/static` (Links will be preserved)\r\n- Layouts will be ported over React to `layouts`\r\n- Data files (such as versions.json and schedule.json) were moved to `data`\r\n- I18n Configuration files and Translations will be moved to `i18n`\r\n\r\n### The deletion of per-locale `site.json` and creation of a global `site.json`\r\n\r\ni18n specific metatdata will be moved to `i18n/config.json` as the aggregate of all i18n metadata. Specific translation texts (such as \"Next\" button) or other translated text will be moved to `i18n` localization files such as `i18n/locales/en.json`. This is the same approach adopted currently on `nodejs.dev` repository to ease the migration.\r\n\r\nNavigation structure and other non-related global metadata will be moved towards a global `data/site.json` and respectively for Navigation to `pages/_meta.json` files.\r\n\r\n### Migration of Handlebars Templates to JSX\r\n\r\nMany of the current \"Handlebars\" scripts (for templating-engine) will be ported to either JavaScript utils or JSX Components, and the current Layouts will also be ported to JSX.\r\n\r\n### Migration from old tooling/scripts\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have scripts to generate the metadata of releases, versions, and the release schedule of Node.js; we should adopt the nodes from Nodejs.dev as they're going to be adopted anyways. This can be done either in this PR or in a follow-up, depending on the complexity of migrating the current scripts.\r\n\r\n## Items to be done after this PR\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, this is an initial implementation for [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/4958), following-up there will still be some improvements to be done, such as removing more legacy content and normalizing the JSX code and a few other things.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we can start porting the layout and content from the [Nodejs.dev repository](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/issues/4958\r\n\r\ncc @nodejs/website @nodejs/nodejs-dev @nodejs/build ",

        "body": "FWIW I just want to restate what I shared in today's working session and what I've said before:\r\n\r\nI highly recommend that we follow a process where voting isn't necessary, and people who are nominated or self-nominate are selected based off of complete consensus - in effect, zero -1s - from the CPC membership. Whether this is voting membership or full CPC membership, I don't particularly mind. If there are _only_ +1s, the person is added to moderation. One minor addition, if there *is* a CPC member who wants to vote -1 but does not want to do so publicly, they should be able to reach out to the Chair and share that -1 with a reason, and have the Chair proxy that -1.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that we need to have dedicated sessions in CPC meetings for this selection to happen. This has happened in GitHub Issues in Node.js for years now without significant issue (there was _one_ time where someone was on an extended vacation and missed a deadline to -1 when they wanted to -1). \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically noting some things from @tobie's suggestion:\r\n\r\n\r\n> As part of their nomination, nominees must agree to abide by the terms of the [COC_TEAM_MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/conduct/COC_TEAM_MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md). (TODO: pull questions from https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/985 to write that up.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIMO this document will be no different than the existing [Membership Expectations](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/conduct/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md) document. If it's _more_ restrictive, I'd prefer Membership Expectations to be updated to be more restrictive.\r\n\r\n> _Substantiated_ objections by CPC members for the inclusion of nominees in the Code of Conduct Team (for example for serious violations of the CoC, a documented history of hate speech, etc.), cannot be overruled by a vote.\r\n\r\nIf there is something else that follows into \"etc\", I would very clearly define it here. Leaving an open end in a space like this results in gray areas that often get ignored or brushed off, which is not a situation I want us to be in for something as important as moderation.\r\n\r\nAlso, how do you define Substantiated? If someone's putting out white supremacist or TERF dog whistles but not explicitly saying things, would that be considered substantiated? \r\n\r\n> There is not a strict number of seats in the Code of Conduct Team. However it is expected that the Code of Conduct Team is composed of at least 5 members (including the ED and Events coordinator), and no more than 12 members total.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request that this also include a section about company affiliation to disallow over-representation of single corporate entities.",

        "body": "> I disagree with you that what i said is based on a fallacy of composition but arguing about that isn't going to add any value here so please let's agree to disagree here.\r\n\r\n@dominikg If you're not willing to discuss or back up a point you made, it probably shouldn't be made. However, I'll not engage on the topic further as long as it's not used any further as a justification for this proposal, per your request 👍🏻 \r\n\r\n> This has nothing to do with the dynamic typed nature of js, so i don't understand why that is being brought into the discussion.\r\n\r\nBecause I've spent a decent amount of my career looking at / working with package registry products and very often \"easy\" solutions are not actually easy for registries of dynamically typed languages. I've seen what you're talking about for static language registries multiple times but have yet to see it in a production dynamic language registry. If I'm missing examples - you stated there are many - in dynamic language registries I'd love to learn about them.\r\n\r\n> Sharing the validation logic can be done, which solves the concerns about being agnostic. I am thankful you care about that, but at the same time you should acknowledge that node.js bundling npm is indeed preferential treatment and has lead to your position that the npm registry and client are by far the most used in the js ecosystem and as a result applying validation at that level is the most effective.\r\n\r\nYarn and pnpm are currently available via corepack in Node.js.\r\n\r\nLast I saw, Yarn had non-trivial double digit representation (IIRC it was around 40%) in package manager usage according to npm registry statistics that were made public (this was some time ago, but I don't think it'd be under double digits at this point).\r\n\r\nI agree with registry (IIRC it's 99%+), but disagree that moving logic like this into the registry is a good idea. Specifically, as was pointed out earlier, this is something npm _explicitly_ doesn't do. Changing that fundamentally changes the scope of what npm is/does and that has a lot of ecosystem-wide repercussions that IMO are not positive.",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

There are very good reasons to use internal registries, but I also frankly don't trust JFrog and Sonatype to correctly build this functionality in a way that effectively serves their users - and again, it would increase the barrier to entry for better options to exist.\r\n\r\n> Right now if you try to run a package with a bad package.json then Node will crash.\r\n\r\nnot sure there's a lot more npm can do if there's a bad package.json?\r\n\r\n> Users would have to somehow first learn this eslint package exists, setup eslint, and setup this new validation package.\r\n\r\nIf this were to ship - which IMO it very much should not in npm - it should be optional and opt-in, not required.",

        "body": "> The way I see it is this: it's either pain for (Vite / Node.js server) users, or npm validates ESM.\r\n\r\n@brillout npm validating ESM will not solve the problem you want it to.\r\n\r\n> I don't get the sentiment that it's outside the scope of the Node Package Manger\r\n\r\nnpm is not an acronym :)\r\n\r\n> but the idea that we're okay with a majority of packages being broken and it's the consumers job' to fix those packages by running them through bundlers instead of running them on Node is a very anti-Node position for the Node Package Manager to be taking.\r\n\r\n@benmccann The majority of packages _are not_ broken. I deeply dislike other package managers for a variety of reasons, but their users still deserve the same foundational support that npm users would get under what you're asking for. Further, I shouldn't have to use a package manager for code that I'm not publishing to validate it - I should be able to do that internalyl without a package manager. This is a platform issue, not a package manager issue.\r\n\r\nPut another way, solving this in npm does not actually solve it. Further, it creates a _very wide_  fracture in the ecosystem. What happens when Yarn starts implementing a definition of \"valid\" that's _slightly_ different than npm? And the same for pnpm? This has happened before (see: resolution algorithms) and it'll happen with this. Inserting this into Node.js - if it's even a good idea, which I'm not really convinced of - would be the way to _actually_ solve your problem. \r\n\r\n> I strongly agree that the goal of keeping npm agnostic has given the ability for developers to ship invalid packages to the registry and poisoning the transition from CJS to ESM.\r\n>\r\n> I’m sad to see that an OSS maintainer had to open an issue to the most used js runtime, and later to npm (owned by github, owned by ms) to solve a validation problem caused by the initial goal of “agnostic” path npm is taken. This is clearly a validation problem.\r\n>\r\n> As a Node core collaborator, and performance enthusiast, from where I’m sitting (after reading all of the responses), I strongly believe that we should do better. Since Node does not have the capacity to validate npm packages before publishing, I believe it should definitely be done in the package manager side.\r\n\r\n@anonrig As a Node.js contributor, I know that Node.js has more resources to solve this than npm does. If it's a problem that you as a collaborator want to see solved, you should solve it in Node.js.\r\n\r\nFrom the Node.js perspective, that is the option that makes sense - it does not tie the platform to a single runtime and helps _all_ users, rather than the subset who _publish_ with npm (since only modules published from npm would be validated - if ). I'd honestly argue it's _actively harmful_ and _preferential_ to users of npm for Node.js collaborators to suggest that this be solved in npm.\r\n\r\n> And it puts the npm registry into a bad light too. If a user encounters an issue with one package, they likely attribute it to that. Multiple apples that turn out to be spoilt, maybe the shop owner is to blame?\r\n\r\n@dominikg This is an assumption that every user will make a [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) in the most distilled form. Outside of theoretical situations, can this be backed up?\r\n\r\n> Many other large software registries have validation processes to ensure a quality level for their content. \r\n\r\nGot examples of this in package registries for dynamically typed languages? I briefly looked through both PyPi's resources and Ruby Gem's resources and couldn't find anything like this but perhaps I missed it.\r\n\r\n> We do not have to catch every possible type of error to provide value, but just point out things that that clearly won't run on Node.js from the package.json alone.\r\n\r\n@benmccann this just sounds like you want linting? why do this in ESLint and/or Prettier rather than npm?",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",
