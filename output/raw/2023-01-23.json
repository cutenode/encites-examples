        "body": "FWIW I just want to restate what I shared in today's working session and what I've said before:\r\n\r\nI highly recommend that we follow a process where voting isn't necessary, and people who are nominated or self-nominate are selected based off of complete consensus - in effect, zero -1s - from the CPC membership. Whether this is voting membership or full CPC membership, I don't particularly mind. If there are _only_ +1s, the person is added to moderation. One minor addition, if there *is* a CPC member who wants to vote -1 but does not want to do so publicly, they should be able to reach out to the Chair and share that -1 with a reason, and have the Chair proxy that -1.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that we need to have dedicated sessions in CPC meetings for this selection to happen. This has happened in GitHub Issues in Node.js for years now without significant issue (there was _one_ time where someone was on an extended vacation and missed a deadline to -1 when they wanted to -1). \r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically noting some things from @tobie's suggestion:\r\n\r\n\r\n> As part of their nomination, nominees must agree to abide by the terms of the [COC_TEAM_MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/conduct/COC_TEAM_MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md). (TODO: pull questions from https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues/985 to write that up.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIMO this document will be no different than the existing [Membership Expectations](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/main/conduct/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md) document. If it's _more_ restrictive, I'd prefer Membership Expectations to be updated to be more restrictive.\r\n\r\n> _Substantiated_ objections by CPC members for the inclusion of nominees in the Code of Conduct Team (for example for serious violations of the CoC, a documented history of hate speech, etc.), cannot be overruled by a vote.\r\n\r\nIf there is something else that follows into \"etc\", I would very clearly define it here. Leaving an open end in a space like this results in gray areas that often get ignored or brushed off, which is not a situation I want us to be in for something as important as moderation.\r\n\r\nAlso, how do you define Substantiated? If someone's putting out white supremacist or TERF dog whistles but not explicitly saying things, would that be considered substantiated? \r\n\r\n> There is not a strict number of seats in the Code of Conduct Team. However it is expected that the Code of Conduct Team is composed of at least 5 members (including the ED and Events coordinator), and no more than 12 members total.\r\n\r\nI'd like to request that this also include a section about company affiliation to disallow over-representation of single corporate entities.",

        "body": "> I disagree with you that what i said is based on a fallacy of composition but arguing about that isn't going to add any value here so please let's agree to disagree here.\r\n\r\n@dominikg If you're not willing to discuss or back up a point you made, it probably shouldn't be made. However, I'll not engage on the topic further as long as it's not used any further as a justification for this proposal, per your request 👍🏻 \r\n\r\n> This has nothing to do with the dynamic typed nature of js, so i don't understand why that is being brought into the discussion.\r\n\r\nBecause I've spent a decent amount of my career looking at / working with package registry products and very often \"easy\" solutions are not actually easy for registries of dynamically typed languages. I've seen what you're talking about for static language registries multiple times but have yet to see it in a production dynamic language registry. If I'm missing examples - you stated there are many - in dynamic language registries I'd love to learn about them.\r\n\r\n> Sharing the validation logic can be done, which solves the concerns about being agnostic. I am thankful you care about that, but at the same time you should acknowledge that node.js bundling npm is indeed preferential treatment and has lead to your position that the npm registry and client are by far the most used in the js ecosystem and as a result applying validation at that level is the most effective.\r\n\r\nYarn and pnpm are currently available via corepack in Node.js.\r\n\r\nLast I saw, Yarn had non-trivial double digit representation (IIRC it was around 40%) in package manager usage according to npm registry statistics that were made public (this was some time ago, but I don't think it'd be under double digits at this point).\r\n\r\nI agree with registry (IIRC it's 99%+), but disagree that moving logic like this into the registry is a good idea. Specifically, as was pointed out earlier, this is something npm _explicitly_ doesn't do. Changing that fundamentally changes the scope of what npm is/does and that has a lot of ecosystem-wide repercussions that IMO are not positive.",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

        "body": "> The way I see it is this: it's either pain for (Vite / Node.js server) users, or npm validates ESM.\r\n\r\n@brillout npm validating ESM will not solve the problem you want it to.\r\n\r\n> I don't get the sentiment that it's outside the scope of the Node Package Manger\r\n\r\nnpm is not an acronym :)\r\n\r\n> but the idea that we're okay with a majority of packages being broken and it's the consumers job' to fix those packages by running them through bundlers instead of running them on Node is a very anti-Node position for the Node Package Manager to be taking.\r\n\r\n@benmccann The majority of packages _are not_ broken. I deeply dislike other package managers for a variety of reasons, but their users still deserve the same foundational support that npm users would get under what you're asking for. Further, I shouldn't have to use a package manager for code that I'm not publishing to validate it - I should be able to do that internalyl without a package manager. This is a platform issue, not a package manager issue.\r\n\r\nPut another way, solving this in npm does not actually solve it. Further, it creates a _very wide_  fracture in the ecosystem. What happens when Yarn starts implementing a definition of \"valid\" that's _slightly_ different than npm? And the same for pnpm? This has happened before (see: resolution algorithms) and it'll happen with this. Inserting this into Node.js - if it's even a good idea, which I'm not really convinced of - would be the way to _actually_ solve your problem. \r\n\r\n> I strongly agree that the goal of keeping npm agnostic has given the ability for developers to ship invalid packages to the registry and poisoning the transition from CJS to ESM.\r\n>\r\n> I’m sad to see that an OSS maintainer had to open an issue to the most used js runtime, and later to npm (owned by github, owned by ms) to solve a validation problem caused by the initial goal of “agnostic” path npm is taken. This is clearly a validation problem.\r\n>\r\n> As a Node core collaborator, and performance enthusiast, from where I’m sitting (after reading all of the responses), I strongly believe that we should do better. Since Node does not have the capacity to validate npm packages before publishing, I believe it should definitely be done in the package manager side.\r\n\r\n@anonrig As a Node.js contributor, I know that Node.js has more resources to solve this than npm does. If it's a problem that you as a collaborator want to see solved, you should solve it in Node.js.\r\n\r\nFrom the Node.js perspective, that is the option that makes sense - it does not tie the platform to a single runtime and helps _all_ users, rather than the subset who _publish_ with npm (since only modules published from npm would be validated - if ). I'd honestly argue it's _actively harmful_ and _preferential_ to users of npm for Node.js collaborators to suggest that this be solved in npm.\r\n\r\n> And it puts the npm registry into a bad light too. If a user encounters an issue with one package, they likely attribute it to that. Multiple apples that turn out to be spoilt, maybe the shop owner is to blame?\r\n\r\n@dominikg This is an assumption that every user will make a [fallacy of composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_composition) in the most distilled form. Outside of theoretical situations, can this be backed up?\r\n\r\n> Many other large software registries have validation processes to ensure a quality level for their content. \r\n\r\nGot examples of this in package registries for dynamically typed languages? I briefly looked through both PyPi's resources and Ruby Gem's resources and couldn't find anything like this but perhaps I missed it.\r\n\r\n> We do not have to catch every possible type of error to provide value, but just point out things that that clearly won't run on Node.js from the package.json alone.\r\n\r\n@benmccann this just sounds like you want linting? why do this in ESLint and/or Prettier rather than npm?",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

This results in the test no longer working. Virual mocks might be an alternative but needs validation.\r\n- [ ] `skipLibCheck` is currently enabled in the `tsconfig.base.json` because `@types/inquirer` and `execa` were throwing issues\r\n- [ ] `useUnknownInCatchVariables` is currently disabled as it was a breaking change between TypeScript 3.x and 4.4 and requires code changes.\r\n- [x] ~Netlify build is currently failing.~\r\n\r\n**Contributing to Twilio**\r\n\r\n> All third-party contributors acknowledge that any contributions they provide will be made under the same open-source license that the open-source project is provided under.\r\n\r\n- [x] I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the project's license.\r\n",

Noting that they exist somewhere on the webstreams docs would _probably_ be a good idea. I just watched two very capable engineers spend longer than they should have figure out that these features existed while trying to use `fetch` and streams because they _weren't_ in the webstreams docs - if they're tripping over this, I very much imagine it will be something that comes up again for others.",

Either is a valid approach IMO, though PR reviewers might disagree with me. I would recommend just having whatever is implemented as a note that links to the actual API docs for those methods, rather than having code examples. However if you also want to improve those API docs, that's of course welcome as well 😊 ",

        "body": "We are currently using Github CI for `test-asan.yml`, `test-linux.yml`, `text-macos.yml` which uses the latest version on all of the workflows. Linux CI machines have 2 cores and macOS machines has 3 cores by default. Latest PR by @Trott shows that using `-j3` instead of `-j2` on macOS builds reduces the build time by 34 minutes (Referencing: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45340).\r\n\r\nThere was a pull request open by @targos to use large runner (https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44908) but later closed due to the unavailability due to Github internals (Referencing @bnb's comment: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44908#issuecomment-1273860959). @richardlau opened a different pull request for using large runners for `test-asan` (Referencing https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45097), but closed it due to `Github's billing system` (Referencing: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45097#issuecomment-1286715840)\r\n\r\nDue to the latest issues with macOS machines (referencing: https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2917), I'd like to open an issue to keep track of the process of requesting and getting access to large runners on Github. Even though the issue with the macOS builds is not related to the GitHub machines, it might be good to rely more on Github hosts and less on the Jenkins hosts for macOS, maybe with the possibility of removing them entirely.\r\n\r\nEven though I don't know what is the correct spec for the node.js builds, afaik the larger the core size, the faster the builds are done. Therefore I believe that getting access to 64 cores of large runners is appropriate for us.

That package effectively does what this proposes to do. For validation that this is something used in the real world by impactful projects, here's a handful of the major projects that received automated updates for older versions of `recursive-readdir` up to 2.2.3: \r\n\r\n* GoogleAPIs\r\n* Gatsby \r\n* a tool that \"provides computational routines for the prediction of detector response and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged particle beams\"\r\n* A dozen or so Postman repos\r\n* create-react-app\r\n* httparchive.org\r\n* jsdelivr\r\n* backstage (a CNCF project)\r\n* metalsmith\r\n\r\nIn addition to a dozen or so other notable projects where unmaintained forks depend upon it but the dependency has been removed (for whatever reason).",

        "body": "### What is the problem this feature will solve?\r\n\r\nNode does not have a version checker that lets the user know if they're on an outdated version. In my opinion, having one would absolutely improve QOL and would help notifying users of new versions.\r\n\r\n### What is the feature you are proposing to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nAdding a ***opt-in*** version checker. I propose it as opt-in because of potential privacy concerns and this could be considered a breaking change due to the additional overhead. Also, I believe it would be best to implement it on the Javascript side just for simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe Node.js website already has a file that is automatically updated with every release ([https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json](https://nodejs.org/dist/index.json)) so all changes that need to be made are in Node core itself.\r\n\r\n * Opt-in via `--check-update` cli argument and you set it to what release branch you follow.\r\n   * This would work like `--version` where it simply checks for an update and then exits.\r\n   * `--check-update=current` - Follows the most current release, User will get notified for any new version.\r\n   * `--check-update=lts` - Follows the most recent LTS release. It will skip any odd-numbered majors and only focuses on the latest release of a LTS version. Ex/ user running `v16.x.x` will get notified for `v18.x.x` but not for `v17.x.x` since it's not LTS\r\n   * `--check-update=same` - Follows whatever major you are on and ignores any updates not pertaining to the major. Ex/ user running `v17.x.x` will get notified for `v17.y.y` but not for `v18.z.z` since it's not on the same major. The name for this isn't great, if someone has a better idea please say so. If the cli argument is passed with no value (`--check-update` and nothing else), this is what it defaults to.\r\n  * `--version-check-url` cli argument in case the user would like to override the url it requests for whatever reason\r\n  * New updates presented to user via `process.emitWarning` with a message such as `New version available! vX.X.X (current) -> vY.Y.Y (new)`. Could also add a note if it's a security release like `New version available! vX.X.X (current) -> vY.Y.Y (new) (security release)`.\r\n  * Any potential errors that occur while checking the version fail silently due to the user not being in control of it and therefore can't really do anything about it\r\n\r\nI am currently working on implementing this and created this issue to open the discussion on it and get some feedback. I have a basic experimental implementation which is linked in the reply directly below this post.\r\n\r\n### What alternatives have you considered?\r\n\r\n_No response_",

        "body": "> I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to implement this feature in Corepack rather than Node.js:\r\n\r\nIMO -1 on a version checking tool going into corepack. Such functionality is outside the expressed scope of that tool.\r\n\r\n> It's also what pkgjs/nv uses.\r\n\r\nI would not recommend looking at pkgjs/nv as a good source of truth - I tried using it and it fundamentally doesn't work as advertised - I had to make my own tooling to get that functionality.\r\n\r\n> The goal is to ship npm through Corepack in the (near?) future.\r\n\r\nIMO this is an especially bad goal that will hurt end-users, but this probably isn't the place for that discussion.\r\n\r\n> It means it would only benefit Corepack users, but it wouldn't change anything for you if you don't use Corepack. So no, people wouldn't need to use Corepack.\r\n\r\nRight, and the goal of this proposal is to benefit Node.js users. IMO if this is the goal of Corepack as a proposed solution, it's a non-starter - I believe that @flakey5 is taking the correct approach by proposing it for Node.js core as a way to help the broader ecosystem ensure they're on the latest version of Node.js, regardless of their package manager tooling.\r\n\r\n> Should the Node.js binary itself, via an opt in command-line option, be able to check to see if there is an updated version available?\r\n\r\nIMO yes +1.\r\n\r\n> I do consider this proposed feature as improving overall Developer Experience (point 4 for why a feature should be added) in Node.js in much the same way that adding other things can be done by others tools does (e.g. a test runner didn't need to be added, an args parser didn't need to be added).\r\n\r\n+1.\r\n\r\n> Also, if we expect third party tools to provide this functionality, they could actually use this mechanism to make their implementations easier and more consistent with each other. I don't expect everyone to agree with that argument, but it's something I consider useful.\r\n\r\n+1. If _additionally_ provided as an API that can be called from user-land, tools like corepack, npm, yarn, and whatever replaces all of those could hook into this and provide opinionated DX, where the under-the-hood implementation doesn't matter to the user _but_ infra/IT folks could have reasonable and consistent control regardless of the tool (for example if they want to block such requests from happening in prod systems + alert when they're attempted). IMO that'd be a massive benefit to a core implementation of this.",
