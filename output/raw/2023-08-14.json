I do _often_ get the right page, but sometimes it's really frustrating to have to figure out how to get the correct page in my language.\r\n\r\nI do also worry about the impact of pages with very similar titles getting flagged as SEO juicing, but that might be a step beyond what's necessary to look at now.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there are very well established guidelines for how to manage localized content and SEO, and my _guess_ is that we're not doing those but I'm not actually certain what they are - I do know quite a bit about SEO but I've never dealt with localization before.",

And the repo has been using `nodevu` for some time. Then we found out that there are some fields that we need but not returned by `nodevu` yet.\r\n\r\nWe need these 2 new fields:\r\n- `date` -> fetched from `index.json` and it's not the same with `support.phases.dates.start`. I am not too sure myself about the historical context behind it. However, it seems like: release date in `index.json` is referring to actual the release date and `support.phases.dates.start` is referring to the support start date (\"current\" status starts).\r\n- `modules.version` -> fetched from `index.json` as well, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases#backref-1) for explanation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state (I haven't added any test or added to the docs), looking forward for your inputs/feedbacks.",

And the repo has been using `nodevu` for some time. Then we found out that there are some fields that we need but not returned by `nodevu` yet.\r\n\r\nWe need these 2 new fields:\r\n- `date` -> fetched from `index.json` and it's not the same with `support.phases.dates.start`. I am not too sure myself about the historical context behind it. However, it seems like: release date in `index.json` is referring to actual the release date and `support.phases.dates.start` is referring to the support start date (\"current\" status starts).\r\n- `modules.version` -> fetched from `index.json` as well, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases#backref-1) for explanation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state (I haven't added any test or added to the docs), looking forward for your inputs/feedbacks.",

Since this data is 100% static and just getting passed through from the source to the module, checking a few known values is enough IMO. Perhaps the earliest known value for each, a random middle value, and then the (current) most recent. Can be / should be hardcoded 👍🏻 ",

Refreshed the home page and at the top of the page was some pretty, uh, Classic Hellthread Content. I feel exceptionally bad for accidentally exposing the people around me to that and would love to see a way to ensure I (and others!) have complete control of what's shown when scrolling the Good Site.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\n\r\nI'd specifically like to see a Settings toggle that forces all images behind the blurred image UI that I believe comes up on some content when you've got Content Filtering set to Warn. This would put all images behind the blured UI.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n- Not Using BlueSky in situations where seeing Classic Hellthread Content isn't appropriate\r\n  - This is not a reasonable solution, as I have ADHD and will forget.\r\n- Toggle to disable images altogether \r\n  - More aggressive for no benefit \r\n- Using filtering\r\n  - Tried this, still saw Classic Hellthread Content. No OCR tools will ever be good enough to filter everything. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n<3",

And the repo has been using `nodevu` for some time. Then we found out that there are some fields that we need but not returned by `nodevu` yet.\r\n\r\nWe need these 2 new fields:\r\n- `date` -> fetched from `index.json` and it's not the same with `support.phases.dates.start`. I am not too sure myself about the historical context behind it. However, it seems like: release date in `index.json` is referring to actual the release date and `support.phases.dates.start` is referring to the support start date (\"current\" status starts).\r\n- `modules.version` -> fetched from `index.json` as well, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases#backref-1) for explanation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state (I haven't added any test or added to the docs), looking forward for your inputs/feedbacks.",

        "body": "Hi @bnb ,\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\nWe are currently consolidating the Node releases data logic/code in `nodejs/nodejs.org` repo (I am referencing this [PR](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/5365)). And the repo has been using `nodevu` for some time. Then we found out that there are some fields that we need but not returned by `nodevu` yet.\r\n\r\nWe need these 2 new fields:\r\n- `date` -> fetched from `index.json` and it's not the same with `support.phases.dates.start`. I am not too sure myself about the historical context behind it. However, it seems like: release date in `index.json` is referring to actual the release date and `support.phases.dates.start` is referring to the support start date (\"current\" status starts).\r\n- `modules.version` -> fetched from `index.json` as well, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases#backref-1) for explanation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state (I haven't added any test or added to the docs), looking forward for your inputs/feedbacks.",

And the repo has been using `nodevu` for some time. Then we found out that there are some fields that we need but not returned by `nodevu` yet.\r\n\r\nWe need these 2 new fields:\r\n- `date` -> fetched from `index.json` and it's not the same with `support.phases.dates.start`. I am not too sure myself about the historical context behind it. However, it seems like: release date in `index.json` is referring to actual the release date and `support.phases.dates.start` is referring to the support start date (\"current\" status starts).\r\n- `modules.version` -> fetched from `index.json` as well, see [this](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases#backref-1) for explanation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is still in draft state (I haven't added any test or added to the docs), looking forward for your inputs/feedbacks.",
