On v17.x, it's available using either `readline/promises` or `node:readline/promises`. This PR removes its access using the prefixless name (`readline/promises` doesn't work anymore, only `node:readline/promises` does). The reason for this proposal is I still have the hope that we might be able to backport `node:`-only core modules to v16.x.\r\n\r\n//cc @nodejs/tsc \r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\nCommit message formatting guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

I've had the idea of this PR reading https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/42430#issuecomment-1076406879, I thought your concern would be resolved if there was more than one core module within the prefix-only rule.\r\n\r\nSome of the reasons I feel that way:\r\n\r\n- There is now over a decade of \"How to use Node.js\" tutorials that explain core concepts of Node.js. Beginning to migrate to `node:` only invalidates those and sets new users up for failure since it's not something that's communicated in any existing ecosystem content.\r\n- Further, my historical experience is that Node.js-specific deviations from the \"norm\" end up being regretted technical debt rather than features everyone is totally happy with. My perspective here is that we should be aiming to _reduce_ Node.js-specific knowledge and _increasing_ portable knowledge, and decisions that entrench us further in Node.js-specific patterns add long-term harm and maintenance burden at the cost of DX.\r\n-  The ecosystem has relatively strongly settled on scopes in day-to-day usage. `node:` is an outlier that doesn't have a peer with adoption. Allowing developers to _choose_ to opt-in to `node:` is IMO a good lever to have to enable developers to know they're getting what they think they're getting, but if we're going to go down the path of _requirement_ we should use the pattern that already has widespread adoption and understanding and doesn't need to be taught (scopes, i.e. `@node/` or `@nodejs/`).\r\n- Given that this is updating an _existing_ module, we're adding maintainer burden and incompatibility for our own benefit with no tangible benefit to those maintainers.\r\n",

On v17.x, it's available using either `readline/promises` or `node:readline/promises`. This PR removes its access using the prefixless name (`readline/promises` doesn't work anymore, only `node:readline/promises` does). The reason for this proposal is I still have the hope that we might be able to backport `node:`-only core modules to v16.x.\r\n\r\n//cc @nodejs/tsc \r\n<!--\r\nBefore submitting a pull request, please read\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\nCommit message formatting guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines\r\n\r\nFor code changes:\r\n1.

Do you mean the dependency can define a hook/script that is run by the CLI? Do you have an example of how something like this looks?\r\n\r\nYeah, you basically nailed it. Given all this is about packages, leveraging that same package ecosystem to extend functionality helps make the CLI more of a platform. I think the closest example would be along the lines of VS Marketplace and VS Code Extensions, except instead of an Electron app it's just a CLI. There are obvious bounds that are needed (an example in VS Code is that certain rendering bits can't be messed with) but providing that sandbox allows for an ecosystem to grow and hook in the workflows you're already using with their products directly into the CLI.",

I think somehow communicating in CLI output that the current implementation is verifying registry-generated signatures _once you've run the command_, that'd be sufficent.\r\n\r\nso, like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm audit signatures\r\n\r\n> verifying registry-generated package signatures 1/1839\r\n```\r\n\r\nand later:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm audit signatures\r\n\r\n> verifying registry-generated package signatures: 1/1839\r\n> verifying author-generated package signatures: 32/992\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Obviously not final UI/UX, but hopefully the point is clear!)",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried\n+- the term \"dependencies\" is in reference to any `Node` found in the `idealTree` returned by `Arborist`\n+\n+#### Selectors\n+    \n+- `*` universal selector\n+- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=\"...\"]`)\n+- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)\n+- `,` selector list delimiter\n+- `.` class selector\n+- `:` pseudo class selector\n+- `>` direct decendent/child selector\n+- `~` sibling selector\n+\n+#### [Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)\n+- `[]` attribute selector (ie. existence of attribute)\n+- `[attribute=value]` attribute value is equivalant...\n+- `[attribute~=value]` attribute value contains word...\n+- `[attribute*=value]` attribute value contains string...\n+- `[attribute|=value]` attribute value is equal to or starts with...\n+- `[attribute^=value]` attribute value begins with...\n+- `[attribute$=value]` attribute value ends with...\n+\n+#### Pseudo Selectors\n+- [`:not(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not)\n+- [`:has(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)\n+- [`:where(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)\n+- [`:is(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is)\n+- [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) matches the root node/dependency\n+- [`:scope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) matches node/dependency it was queried against\n+- [`:empty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) when a dependency has no dependencies\n+- [`:private`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#private) when a dependency is private\n+- `:link` when a dependency is linked\n+- `:deduped` when a dependency has been deduped\n+- `:override` when a dependency is an override\n+- `:extraneous` when a dependency could be but is not deduped\n+- `:outdated` when a dependency is not `latest`\n+- `:vulnerable` when a dependency has a `CVE` \n+- `:semver(<spec>)` matching a valid [`node-semver`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) spec\n+- `:path(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies path relative to the project\n+- `:realpath(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies realpath\n+- `:type(<type>)` [based on currently recognized types](https://github.com/npm/npm-package-arg#result-object)\n+\n+#### Generic Pseudo Selectors:\n+\n+A standardized pseudo selector pattern will be used for `Object`s, `Array`s or `Arrays` of `Object`s accessible via `Arborist`'s `Node.package` metadata. Pseudo classes generated in this way will allow for iterative attribute selection.\n+\n+`Array`s specifically use a special `value` keyword in place of a typical attribute name. `Arrays` also support exact `valu`e matching when a `String` is passed to the selector.

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried\n+- the term \"dependencies\" is in reference to any `Node` found in the `idealTree` returned by `Arborist`\n+\n+#### Selectors\n+    \n+- `*` universal selector\n+- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=\"...\"]`)\n+- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)\n+- `,` selector list delimiter\n+- `.` class selector\n+- `:` pseudo class selector\n+- `>` direct decendent/child selector\n+- `~` sibling selector\n+\n+#### [Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)\n+- `[]` attribute selector (ie. existence of attribute)\n+- `[attribute=value]` attribute value is equivalant...\n+- `[attribute~=value]` attribute value contains word...\n+- `[attribute*=value]` attribute value contains string...\n+- `[attribute|=value]` attribute value is equal to or starts with...\n+- `[attribute^=value]` attribute value begins with...\n+- `[attribute$=value]` attribute value ends with...\n+\n+#### Pseudo Selectors\n+- [`:not(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not)\n+- [`:has(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)\n+- [`:where(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)\n+- [`:is(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is)\n+- [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) matches the root node/dependency\n+- [`:scope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) matches node/dependency it was queried against\n+- [`:empty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) when a dependency has no dependencies\n+- [`:private`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#private) when a dependency is private\n+- `:link` when a dependency is linked\n+- `:deduped` when a dependency has been deduped\n+- `:override` when a dependency is an override\n+- `:extraneous` when a dependency could be but is not deduped\n+- `:outdated` when a dependency is not `latest`\n+- `:vulnerable` when a dependency has a `CVE` \n+- `:semver(<spec>)` matching a valid [`node-semver`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) spec\n+- `:path(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies path relative to the project\n+- `:realpath(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies realpath\n+- `:type(<type>)` [based on currently recognized types](https://github.com/npm/npm-package-arg#result-object)\n+\n+#### Generic Pseudo Selectors:\n+\n+A standardized pseudo selector pattern will be used for `Object`s, `Array`s or `Arrays` of `Object`s accessible via `Arborist`'s `Node.package` metadata. Pseudo classes generated in this way will allow for iterative attribute selection.\n+\n+`Array`s specifically use a special `value` keyword in place of a typical attribute name. `Arrays` also support exact `valu`e matching when a `String` is passed to the selector. See examples below:\n+\n+#### Example of an `Object`: \n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a `scripts.test` containing `\"tap\"` */\n+*:scripts([test~=tap])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` Attribute Selection:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a keyword that begins with \"react\" */\n+*:keywords([value^=\"react\"])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` matching directly to a value:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have the exact keyword \"react\" */\n+/* this is equivalent to `*:keywords([value=\"react\"])` */\n+*:keywords(\"react\")\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` of `Object`s: \n+```css\n+/* returns */\n+*:contributors([email=\"ruyadorno@github.com\"])`\n+```\n+\n+### Classes\n+\n+Given that `Arborist` will control our understanding of the DOM (Dependency Object Model), claseses are predefined by their relationships to their ancestors & are specific to their dependency type. Dependencies may have, & are allowed to have, multiple classifications (ex. a `workspace` may also be a `dev` dependency).\n+\n+- `.prod`\n+- `.dev`\n+- `.optional`\n+- `.peer`\n+- `.bundled`\n+- `.workspace`\n+\n+### Attributes\n+\n+There are several known attributes that are normalized & queryable living in `Node.package` (aka. `package.json`).\n+\n+- `[name]`\n+- `[version]`\n+- `[description]`\n+- `[homepage]`\n+- `[bugs]`\n+- `[author]`\n+- `[license]`\n+- `[funding]`\n+- `[files]`\n+- `[main]`\n+- `[browser]`\n+- `[bin]`\n+- `[man]`\n+- `[directories]`\n+- `[repository]`\n+- `[scripts]`\n+- `[config]`\n+- `[workspaces]`\n+- `[dependencies]`\n+- `[devDependencies]`\n+- `[optionalDependencies]`\n+- `[bundledDependencies]`\n+- `[peerDependencies]`\n+- `[peerDependenciesMeta]`\n+- `[engines]`\n+- `[os]`\n+- `[cpu]`\n+- `[keywords]`\n+\n+### Command\n+\n+#### `npm query \"<selector>\"` (alias `q`)\n+\n+#### Options:\n+\n+- `query-output`\n+  - Default: `json`\n+  - Type: `json`, `list`, `explain`, `outdated`, `funding`, `audit`, `duplicates`, `file`\n+\n+#### Response Output\n+\n+- an array of dependency objects is returned which can contain multiple copies of the same package which may or may not have been linked or deduped\n+\n+```json\n+[\n+  {\n+    \"name\": \"\",\n+    \"version\": \"\",\n+    \"description\": \"\",\n+    \"homepage\": \"\",\n+    \"bugs\": {},\n+    \"author\": {},\n+    \"license\": {},\n+    \"funding\": {},\n+    \"files\": [],\n+    \"main\": \"\",\n+    \"browser\": \"\",\n+    \"bin\": {},\n+    \"man\": [],\n+    \"directories\": {},\n+    \"repository\": {},\n+    \"scripts\": {},\n+    \"config\": {},\n+    \"dependencies\": {},\n+    \"devDependencies\": {},\n+    \"optionalDependencies\": {},\n+    \"bundledDependencies\": {},\n+    \"peerDependencies\": {},\n+    \"peerDependenciesMeta\": {},\n+    \"engines\": {},\n+    \"os\": [],\n+    \"cpu\": [],\n+    \"workspaces\": {},\n+    \"keywords\": [],\n+    \"ancenstry\": \"\",\n+    \"path\": \"\",\n+    \"realpath\": \"\",\n+    \"parent\": \"\",\n+    \"vulnerabilities\": [],\n+    \"cwe\": []\n+  },\n+  ...\n+```\n+\n+#### Usage\n+\n+```bash\n+npm query \":root > .workspace > *\"  # get all workspace direct deps\n+```\n+\n+### Extended Example Queries & Use Cases\n+\n+```stylus\n+// all deps\n+*\n+\n+// all direct deps\n+:root > *\n+\n+// direct production deps\n+:root > .prod\n+\n+// direct development deps\n+:root > .dev \n+\n+// any peer dep of a direct deps\n+:root > * > .peer  \n+  \n+// any workspace dep\n+.workspace\n+\n+// all workspaces that depend on another workspace\n+.workspace > .workspace\n+    \n+// all workspaces that have peer deps\n+.workspace:has(*.peer)\n+\n+// any dep named \"lodash\"\n+// equivalent to [name=\"lodash\"]\n+#lodash \n+  \n+// any deps named \"lodash\" & within semver range ^\"1.2.3\"\n+#lodash@^1.2.3\n+// equivalent to...\n+[name=\"lodash\"]:semver(^1.2.3)\n+\n+// get the hoisted node for a given semver range\n+#lodash@^1.2.3:not(:deduped)\n+\n+// querying deps with a specific version\n+#lodash@2.1.5\n+// equivalent to...\n+[name=\"lodash\"][version=\"2.1.5\"]\n+  \n+// all deps living alongside vulnerable deps\n+*:vulnerable ~ *:not(:vulnerable)\n+\n+// has any deps\n+*:has(*)\n+\n+// has any vulnerable deps\n+*:has(*:vulnerable)\n+\n+// deps with no other deps (ie. \"leaf\" nodes)\n+*:empty\n+\n+// all vulnerable deps that aren't dev deps & that aren't vulnerable to CWE-1333\n+*:vulnerable:not(.dev:cwe(1333))\n+  \n+// manually querying git dependencies\n+*[repository^=\"github:\"],\n+*[repository^=\"git:\"],\n+*[repository^=\"https://github.com\"],\n+*[repository^=\"http://github.com\"],\n+*[repository^=\"https://github.com\"],\n+*[repository^=\"+git:...\"]\n+  \n+// querying for all git dependencies\n+*:type(git)\n+\n+// find all references to \"install\" scripts\n+*[scripts=install], \n+*[scripts=postinstall],\n+*[scripts=preinstall]\n+\n+// get production dependencies that aren't also dev deps\n+.prod:not(.dev)\n+    \n+// get dependencies with specific licenses\n+*[license=\"MIT\"], *[license=\"ISC\"]\n+\n+// find all packages that have @ruyadorno as a contributor\n+*:contributors([email=ruyadorno@github.com])\n+```\n+\n+## Next Steps\n+\n+### Command Mapping to `query-output`\n+\n+Previous commands with similar behaivours will now be able to utilize `Aborist` `Node.querySelectorAll()` under-the-hood & will fast-follow the `npm query` implementation.",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried\n+- the term \"dependencies\" is in reference to any `Node` found in the `idealTree` returned by `Arborist`\n+\n+#### Selectors\n+    \n+- `*` universal selector\n+- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=\"...\"]`)\n+- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)\n+- `,` selector list delimiter\n+- `.` class selector\n+- `:` pseudo class selector\n+- `>` direct decendent/child selector\n+- `~` sibling selector\n+\n+#### [Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)\n+- `[]` attribute selector (ie. existence of attribute)\n+- `[attribute=value]` attribute value is equivalant...\n+- `[attribute~=value]` attribute value contains word...\n+- `[attribute*=value]` attribute value contains string...\n+- `[attribute|=value]` attribute value is equal to or starts with...\n+- `[attribute^=value]` attribute value begins with...\n+- `[attribute$=value]` attribute value ends with...\n+\n+#### Pseudo Selectors\n+- [`:not(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not)\n+- [`:has(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)\n+- [`:where(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)\n+- [`:is(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is)\n+- [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) matches the root node/dependency\n+- [`:scope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) matches node/dependency it was queried against\n+- [`:empty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) when a dependency has no dependencies\n+- [`:private`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#private) when a dependency is private\n+- `:link` when a dependency is linked\n+- `:deduped` when a dependency has been deduped\n+- `:override` when a dependency is an override\n+- `:extraneous` when a dependency could be but is not deduped\n+- `:outdated` when a dependency is not `latest`\n+- `:vulnerable` when a dependency has a `CVE` \n+- `:semver(<spec>)` matching a valid [`node-semver`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) spec\n+- `:path(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies path relative to the project\n+- `:realpath(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies realpath\n+- `:type(<type>)` [based on currently recognized types](https://github.com/npm/npm-package-arg#result-object)\n+\n+#### Generic Pseudo Selectors:\n+\n+A standardized pseudo selector pattern will be used for `Object`s, `Array`s or `Arrays` of `Object`s accessible via `Arborist`'s `Node.package` metadata. Pseudo classes generated in this way will allow for iterative attribute selection.\n+\n+`Array`s specifically use a special `value` keyword in place of a typical attribute name. `Arrays` also support exact `valu`e matching when a `String` is passed to the selector. See examples below:\n+\n+#### Example of an `Object`: \n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a `scripts.test` containing `\"tap\"` */\n+*:scripts([test~=tap])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` Attribute Selection:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a keyword that begins with \"react\" */\n+*:keywords([value^=\"react\"])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` matching directly to a value:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have the exact keyword \"react\" */\n+/* this is equivalent to `*:keywords([value=\"react\"])` */\n+*:keywords(\"react\")\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` of `Object`s: \n+```css\n+/* returns */\n+*:contributors([email=\"ruyadorno@github.com\"])`\n+```\n+\n+### Classes\n+\n+Given that `Arborist` will control our understanding of the DOM (Dependency Object Model), claseses are predefined by their relationships to their ancestors & are specific to their dependency type.

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried\n+- the term \"dependencies\" is in reference to any `Node` found in the `idealTree` returned by `Arborist`\n+\n+#### Selectors\n+    \n+- `*` universal selector\n+- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=\"...\"]`)\n+- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)\n+- `,` selector list delimiter\n+- `.` class selector\n+- `:` pseudo class selector\n+- `>` direct decendent/child selector\n+- `~` sibling selector\n+\n+#### [Attribute Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors)\n+- `[]` attribute selector (ie. existence of attribute)\n+- `[attribute=value]` attribute value is equivalant...\n+- `[attribute~=value]` attribute value contains word...\n+- `[attribute*=value]` attribute value contains string...\n+- `[attribute|=value]` attribute value is equal to or starts with...\n+- `[attribute^=value]` attribute value begins with...\n+- `[attribute$=value]` attribute value ends with...\n+\n+#### Pseudo Selectors\n+- [`:not(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not)\n+- [`:has(<selector>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has)\n+- [`:where(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:where)\n+- [`:is(<selector list>)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:is)\n+- [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) matches the root node/dependency\n+- [`:scope`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) matches node/dependency it was queried against\n+- [`:empty`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty) when a dependency has no dependencies\n+- [`:private`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#private) when a dependency is private\n+- `:link` when a dependency is linked\n+- `:deduped` when a dependency has been deduped\n+- `:override` when a dependency is an override\n+- `:extraneous` when a dependency could be but is not deduped\n+- `:outdated` when a dependency is not `latest`\n+- `:vulnerable` when a dependency has a `CVE` \n+- `:semver(<spec>)` matching a valid [`node-semver`](https://github.com/npm/node-semver) spec\n+- `:path(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies path relative to the project\n+- `:realpath(<path>)` [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) matching based on dependencies realpath\n+- `:type(<type>)` [based on currently recognized types](https://github.com/npm/npm-package-arg#result-object)\n+\n+#### Generic Pseudo Selectors:\n+\n+A standardized pseudo selector pattern will be used for `Object`s, `Array`s or `Arrays` of `Object`s accessible via `Arborist`'s `Node.package` metadata. Pseudo classes generated in this way will allow for iterative attribute selection.\n+\n+`Array`s specifically use a special `value` keyword in place of a typical attribute name. `Arrays` also support exact `valu`e matching when a `String` is passed to the selector. See examples below:\n+\n+#### Example of an `Object`: \n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a `scripts.test` containing `\"tap\"` */\n+*:scripts([test~=tap])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` Attribute Selection:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have a keyword that begins with \"react\" */\n+*:keywords([value^=\"react\"])\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` matching directly to a value:\n+```css\n+/* return dependencies that have the exact keyword \"react\" */\n+/* this is equivalent to `*:keywords([value=\"react\"])` */\n+*:keywords(\"react\")\n+```\n+\n+#### Example of an `Array` of `Object`s: \n+```css\n+/* returns */\n+*:contributors([email=\"ruyadorno@github.com\"])`\n+```\n+\n+### Classes\n+\n+Given that `Arborist` will control our understanding of the DOM (Dependency Object Model), claseses are predefined by their relationships to their ancestors & are specific to their dependency type. Dependencies may have, & are allowed to have, multiple classifications (ex. a `workspace` may also be a `dev` dependency).\n+\n+- `.prod`\n+- `.dev`\n+- `.optional`\n+- `.peer`\n+- `.bundled`\n+- `.workspace`\n+\n+### Attributes\n+\n+There are several known attributes that are normalized & queryable living in `Node.package` (aka. `package.json`).",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)\n+\n+### Dependency Selector Syntax\n+\n+#### Overview:\n+- there is no \"type\" or \"tag\" selectors (ex. `div, h1, a`) as a dependency/target is the only type of `Node` that can be queried\n+- the term \"dependencies\" is in reference to any `Node` found in the `idealTree` returned by `Arborist`\n+\n+#### Selectors\n+    \n+- `*` universal selector\n+- `#<name>` dependency selector (equivalent to `[name=\"...\"]`)\n+- `#<name>@<version>` (equivalent to `[name=<name>]:semver(<version>)`)\n+- `,` selector list delimiter\n+- `.` class selector\n+- `:` pseudo class selector",

Notably, we'll introduce limited net-new classes, states & syntax to ensure the widest adoption & understanding of paradigms. When deviating, we'll explicitely state why & how.\n+\n+## Implementation\n+\n+- `Arborist`'s `Node` Class will have a new `.querySelectorAll()` method\n+  - this method will return a filtered, flattened dependency Arborist `Node` list based on a valid query selector\n+- Introduce a new command, `npm query`, which will take a dependency selector & output a flattened dependency Node list (output is in `json` by default, but configurable)",

There's usually a short cat-herding time at the start of the meeting and then occasionally we have some quick private business to attend to before we can start recording & streaming. So be patient and it should show up.\n* youtube admin page: <https://www.youtube.com/my_live_events?filter=scheduled>\n\n",

People are still being surprised by some relatively important PRs late in the process and sometimes even after they have landed, even though they follow all of our guidelines for waiting time, approvals etc.\r\n\r\nWould it make any sense to try and tag PR/issues as `notable` and send out a daily summary? I suspect we could build a GitHub action to run a query and send out an email.  I'm thinking an email as I don't think GitHub actions can be configured to call out something specific like that in a way that would be visible (at least I have no idea how to do that).\r\n\r\nThe existing `notable-change` label would not be the right thing as it may be added later on if something should be called out in the changelog (based on the description for it) versus a tag added up front.\r\n\r\nThe main ask on collaborators would be to add the `notable` label to appropriate PRs that they open or that they review.\r\n\r\n",

I worked a bit ago on [encites](https://github.com/cutenode/encites) for my team at Microsoft to report what we're doing in Open Source, and figured the concepts wouldn't be too hard to transfer over to filtering data from an org.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there's a lot of opacity in what GitHub counts as \"updated\" and it's a bit harder to filter just for that. I paired with a friend at GitHub and built out a GraphQL query that gets most public \"activity\" in the org, just need to convert it to Markdown (should be pretty easy) and I can share. My plan was to share this code and propose it run weekly and auto-generate a blog post that can go on nodejs.org, but I happened across this issue and figured I could share that I was working on this now. If folks do want to do a label, that's totally fine too - I can set issues/PRs/discussions with those labels apart in the markdown for easier visibility, too.",

Individually excluding unlocked patterns (e.g., `-name:\"syncopation-53\"`) would become more tedious as unlocked patterns increase.\r\n## New filter description\r\nThis new feature would add a filter like `craftable:unlockable` (idk the naming convention) to filter deepsight weapons with patterns that haven't been unlocked yet, i.e., incomplete pattern progress in Records > Patterns & Catalysts:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31776312/158923621-0187c99c-2fa3-4e62-9dc5-0916ce70d21b.png)\r\n## Related issue\r\nThis issue is related to #8085 in that it needs information from `Records`.\r\n\r\n### How does this fit into your workflow?\r\n\r\nThis would be useful when I want to focus on unlocking crafting patterns without going back and forth between `Inventory` and `Records`. I could see on the Inventory page which deepsight weapons to use to gain pattern progress.",

        "body": "per the recent discussion around the moderation team and importing/exporting the blocklist across our three orgs (nodejs, pkgjs, and nodejs-private), I went ahead and built out a GitHub Action that allows us to import blocklists from one organization to another organization. In practice, this means that if someone is blocked in the `nodejs` org, that block can be imported to the other organizations automatically (presumably on a cron or manual run of the Action, rather than being directly triggered by the block event).\r\n\r\nYou can find the code in [cutenode/action-import-blocklist](https://github.com/cutenode/action-import-blocklist). Implementing it requires a PAT from an account (presumably, in our case, the Node.js bot account) that has the full `admin:org` permissions, which is required by the GitHub API.\r\n\r\n@nodejs/tsc @nodejs/actions want to get feedback on this. My proposal:\r\n\r\n- implement syncing to `pkgjs` and `nodejs-private` by setting up `.github` repositories in both and adding workflows. I'm happy to help with this, but it's pretty trivial.\r\n- alternatively, implement syncing by setting up a `.github` repo in the `nodejs` org, allowing us to have control within the project of where our blocklist is being exported to and not providing `admin:org` tokens to those orgs (pkgjs is notably more permissive).\r\n\r\nquestions I have:\r\n- currently, the Action uses `console.log()` to output what's happening. This does include usernames. Is this okay, or would we want to omit those?\r\n- I'd prefer to move the action to a project-owned organization. Does this belong under `nodejs` or under `pkgjs`?",

Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhile js became more and more popular, typescript and flow appears to deal with  stability and maintainability for large projects, yet we lack support for type definitions for Node.js core api. I think the needs goes strong and strong, one proof is that https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/node has reached 23 million download weekly.\r\n\r\nCommunity already has `@type/node`, should we really support it in core ?\r\nI think we should, here are the reasons:\r\n\r\n### It's not reflect the api change quickly enough\r\nFor example, the `wasi` api takes some time added to the repo.\r\nApis like newly or changed takes time to get adopted, developers will has\r\nto wait for this.\r\n\r\n### It's not related to Node.js version consistently\r\nthis package doesn't related Node.js versions. But we has lts, latest and other versions, this can be problematic and got surprised behavior. If we have \r\nofficial support, developers can choose the related version and got precise result.\r\n\r\n### other\r\nIt's only for typescript. We can expand our official type system to flow or other newly solutions.\r\nAlso contribute to this package is too much pain.\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI am thinking we generate types file from our markdown doc or js source file (the `libs` folder ), not sure whether this eventually can work. Another solution is we invent a new dsl :)\r\n\r\nEventually we should make should publish types package when we release a new Node.js version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It might be nice if we could do *everything* through that scope (e.g. `@nodejs/fs`, `@nodejs/querystring`), but I'm more fine with that being how the edge case manifests specifically because that's a pattern that the ecosystem has relatively normalized and because we presumably have the ability to make decision to normalize on that for all modules down the road.\n\nWith the `node:` prefix, I'd prefer if the require name didn't change though. So `node:@nodejs/test` rather than `node:test`. AFAIK the latter would set a precedent of mutating module names, and which is again creating an edge case for a single module. ",

        "body": "FWIW I also particularly don't like the `test_runner` namespace. IMO underscores should be avoided if there's _any_ way to do so, but I explicitly didn't comment on the original thread because I didn't feel like there was a good alternative available.\r\n\r\nPersonally, creating new and unique edge cases that people will have to learn is **significantly worse** than having an underscore in a name (and I _really_ hate underscores.)\r\n\r\nThinking about this from the perspective of someone who's having to switch to Node.js occasionally for their job from their preferred language/platform or thinking about it from the perspective of someone who's just learning to code, this is a confusing departure for reasons that are beyond anything that will impact them or that they'll care about in the near term. IMO we should want to set them up for success with testing, and introducing an oddity like this explicitly increases the barrier to that.",

I've also heard this from other folks - extremely skilled engineers - I've talked to who were trying to pick up workspaces, prior to me using them. Upon reaching out to folks that I think most others wouldn't have available to them, I was able to understand that the modules were symlinked from node_modules. Great!\r\n\r\nThe one pain point with that is that it's not entirely obvious what the \"correct\" way to do this is. Sometimes it works magically, but other times it doesn't. This seems to be because this symlinking feature is hidden behind `npm install`, either at the root or in the new workspace you want to add (`npm install -w myspace`).\r\n\r\nI'd like to request that this be improved in _some_ way. Here are the ways I've thought of:\r\n- triggering symlinking more often: when i `npm i -w lol`, symlink `lol`. I assume this has to do with Arborist, so I'm not sure what the simplest way to do this is but ideally taking whatever path has the least perf impact would be ideal.\r\n- manually triggering symlinking: I can think of cases where a manual trigger outside of `npm install` might be useful (people who want to manually do everything, external tooling that does it but not the linking). `npm ws link` or something like that.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n<!-- Examples\r\nAn example of what your idea might or could do for you and others.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### How\r\n#### Current Behaviour\r\n```bash\r\nnpm init -w myspace\r\nnpm install # it's unexpected that I have to do this!\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Desired Behaviour\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -w myspace # automatically links on init!\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm ws link # links all workspaces!\r\nnpm ws link myspace # just links myspace!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* n/a\r\n",

Upon reaching out to folks that I think most others wouldn't have available to them, I was able to understand that the modules were symlinked from node_modules. Great!\r\n\r\nThe one pain point with that is that it's not entirely obvious what the \"correct\" way to do this is. Sometimes it works magically, but other times it doesn't. This seems to be because this symlinking feature is hidden behind `npm install`, either at the root or in the new workspace you want to add (`npm install -w myspace`).\r\n\r\nI'd like to request that this be improved in _some_ way. Here are the ways I've thought of:\r\n- triggering symlinking more often: when i `npm i -w lol`, symlink `lol`. I assume this has to do with Arborist, so I'm not sure what the simplest way to do this is but ideally taking whatever path has the least perf impact would be ideal.\r\n- manually triggering symlinking: I can think of cases where a manual trigger outside of `npm install` might be useful (people who want to manually do everything, external tooling that does it but not the linking). `npm ws link` or something like that.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n<!-- Examples\r\nAn example of what your idea might or could do for you and others.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### How\r\n#### Current Behaviour\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -w myspace\r\nnpm install # it's unexpected that I have to do this!\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Desired Behaviour\r\n```bash\r\nnpm i -w myspace # automatically links on init!\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm ws link # links all workspaces!\r\nnpm ws link myspace # just links myspace!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* n/a\r\n",

        "body": "Hi All:\r\n\r\nThe Foundation would like to get the broad Node.js User Survey back off the ground. Last year, we made a bunch of progress in getting community feedback (https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/380 ) but needed to pause due to other priorities.\r\n\r\nWe also had some legal feedback pertaining to how extensive and in-depth our data set was regarding GDPR protected data / Personal Identifying Information, and it's been advised we remove it. These would be questions 6,7 and 10-15. We are opting to keep question 5 as it would be helpful for developer outreach.\r\n \r\nSeveral of our questions ask about gender identity, ethnic origin, and even health. Later questions invite a recipient to share their identity. Even without volunteering that data, the data set is so extensive that it's possible that some individuals could be identified algorithmically if someone were able to get access to the database.\r\n\r\nCollecting and storing that data could present risk to the Foundation that we are not comfortable with (potential liability that could lead to significant mitigation costs if the data is ever compromised).\r\n\r\nWe do have a goal of serving underrepresented communities, so we recommend adding a general question around this. For example, our Events team asks in registrations, \"do you identify with underrepresented communities?”\r\n\r\nRE surveys moving forward, the recommendation from the Foundation is that after this big survey, we will be moving more toward smaller, more focused surveys that will provide specific insights to individual projects (The Unhandled Promises Survey from the Node.js TSC is an example of how we will try surveys in the future.)\r\n \r\nHere's the survey in a google doc:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcRB6M7snS-7qJD0kB1RGl9DE2whVNNjM-ubftbsSo0/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nI’ll keep this open for a week for discussion and then I’d like to move forward to setting up and administering the survey. Thanks all!\r\n",

        "body": "Hi All:\r\n\r\nThe Foundation would like to get the broad Node.js User Survey back off the ground. Last year, we made a bunch of progress in getting community feedback (https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/380 ) but needed to pause due to other priorities.\r\n\r\nWe also had some legal feedback pertaining to how extensive and in-depth our data set was regarding GDPR protected data / Personal Identifying Information, and it's been advised we remove it. These would be questions 6,7 and 10-15. We are opting to keep question 5 as it would be helpful for developer outreach.\r\n \r\nSeveral of our questions ask about gender identity, ethnic origin, and even health. Later questions invite a recipient to share their identity. Even without volunteering that data, the data set is so extensive that it's possible that some individuals could be identified algorithmically if someone were able to get access to the database.\r\n\r\nCollecting and storing that data could present risk to the Foundation that we are not comfortable with (potential liability that could lead to significant mitigation costs if the data is ever compromised).\r\n\r\nWe do have a goal of serving underrepresented communities, so we recommend adding a general question around this. For example, our Events team asks in registrations, \"do you identify with underrepresented communities?”\r\n\r\nRE surveys moving forward, the recommendation from the Foundation is that after this big survey, we will be moving more toward smaller, more focused surveys that will provide specific insights to individual projects (The Unhandled Promises Survey from the Node.js TSC is an example of how we will try surveys in the future.)\r\n \r\nHere's the survey in a google doc:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcRB6M7snS-7qJD0kB1RGl9DE2whVNNjM-ubftbsSo0/edit?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nI’ll keep this open for a week for discussion and then I’d like to move forward to setting up and administering the survey. Thanks all!\r\n",

        "body": "[Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is a great free automation utility for GitHub, [Probot Settings](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/) is an app that syncs repository settings defined in `.github/settings.yml` to GitHub API, enabling repositories to version control their own settings and allow Pull Requests for them.\r\n\r\nThis allows controlling ALL aspects of a github repository, from name & description, to labels & collaborators, and even branch protection configuration.\r\n\r\n> #### Live Example\r\n> \r\n> I personally use this for my own accounts and for work _(`github.com/telus`)_ this allows me and my team mates to provision new repositories with some configuration already scaffolded.\r\n> \r\n> here's my root configuration: https://github.com/ahmadnassri/.github\r\n> \r\n> here's one of my repos that `_extends`: the root configuration: https://github.com/ahmadnassri/node-api-problem/blob/master/.github/settings.yml\r\n\r\n## Node.js Useage\r\n\r\nI propose creating a `.github` repository with some basic root configuration, here is my reccomendation:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nrepository:\r\n  topics: nodejs\r\n  homepage: https://nodejs.org/\r\n  private: false\r\n  has_issues: true\r\n  has_wiki: false\r\n  has_downloads: false\r\n  has_projects: false\r\n  default_branch: master\r\n  allow_squash_merge: true\r\n  allow_merge_commit: false\r\n  allow_rebase_merge: true\r\n\r\nlabels:\r\n  - name: Good First Issue\r\n    description: Good for newcomers\r\n    color: 7057ff\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepos then would add `.github/settings.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n_extends: .github\r\n\r\nrepository:\r\n  name: my-repo-name\r\n  description: meaningful description\r\n  topics: nodejs, is, awesome\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n- There should be a good existing starter example for labels in Node projects here, so lets pick from those. Having labels configured and available from the start of a repo is crucial for open collaboration.\r\n\r\n- Prefer that we include _branch protection_ configuration, however that might prove controversial.\r\n\r\n- Probot Settings support extending templates, so we can have purpose based starter templates:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  # a template for working groups repos\r\n  _extends: .github:group.yml\r\n\r\n  # a template for code repos\r\n  _extends: .github:code.yml\r\n\r\n  # a template for anything\r\n  _extends: .github:something-special.yml\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Steps needed\r\n\r\n- a member with `owner` GitHub privileges installs Probot from: https://github.com/apps/settings \r\n- a repo named `.github` is created with a starting default template _(I can start that once we have sign off)_\r\n- teams and projects can start adopting into their own repos by including a `.github/settings.yml`",

        "body": "[Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is a great free automation utility for GitHub, [Probot Settings](https://probot.github.io/apps/settings/) is an app that syncs repository settings defined in `.github/settings.yml` to GitHub API, enabling repositories to version control their own settings and allow Pull Requests for them.\r\n\r\nThis allows controlling ALL aspects of a github repository, from name & description, to labels & collaborators, and even branch protection configuration.\r\n\r\n> #### Live Example\r\n> \r\n> I personally use this for my own accounts and for work _(`github.com/telus`)_ this allows me and my team mates to provision new repositories with some configuration already scaffolded.\r\n> \r\n> here's my root configuration: https://github.com/ahmadnassri/.github\r\n> \r\n> here's one of my repos that `_extends`: the root configuration: https://github.com/ahmadnassri/node-api-problem/blob/master/.github/settings.yml\r\n\r\n## Node.js Useage\r\n\r\nI propose creating a `.github` repository with some basic root configuration, here is my reccomendation:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nrepository:\r\n  topics: nodejs\r\n  homepage: https://nodejs.org/\r\n  private: false\r\n  has_issues: true\r\n  has_wiki: false\r\n  has_downloads: false\r\n  has_projects: false\r\n  default_branch: master\r\n  allow_squash_merge: true\r\n  allow_merge_commit: false\r\n  allow_rebase_merge: true\r\n\r\nlabels:\r\n  - name: Good First Issue\r\n    description: Good for newcomers\r\n    color: 7057ff\r\n```\r\n\r\nRepos then would add `.github/settings.yml`:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n_extends: .github\r\n\r\nrepository:\r\n  name: my-repo-name\r\n  description: meaningful description\r\n  topics: nodejs, is, awesome\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n- There should be a good existing starter example for labels in Node projects here, so lets pick from those. Having labels configured and available from the start of a repo is crucial for open collaboration.\r\n\r\n- Prefer that we include _branch protection_ configuration, however that might prove controversial.\r\n\r\n- Probot Settings support extending templates, so we can have purpose based starter templates:\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  # a template for working groups repos\r\n  _extends: .github:group.yml\r\n\r\n  # a template for code repos\r\n  _extends: .github:code.yml\r\n\r\n  # a template for anything\r\n  _extends: .github:something-special.yml\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Steps needed\r\n\r\n- a member with `owner` GitHub privileges installs Probot from: https://github.com/apps/settings \r\n- a repo named `.github` is created with a starting default template _(I can start that once we have sign off)_\r\n- teams and projects can start adopting into their own repos by including a `.github/settings.yml`",

I mentioned some of this in the  survey also.\r\n\r\nThe official blog is still linked to https://nodejs.org/en/blog/ but as you can see this isn't really a blog, this is a list of release notes.  It's titled \"News\" but to be honest I wouldn't even call it that, it's just a changelog.  There are useful blog posts intermixed with the changelog such as https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/jan-2018-spectre-meltdown/.\r\n\r\nSo to get around this I understand there is a new blog for Node on Medium https://nodejs.medium.com/ (I'm assuming this is now the official one). The issue is it took me a long time to find this, nothing links to it. Googling \"Node[js] Blog\" brings me here https://nodejs.org/en/blog/ and the medium result is near the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nPossible approach:\r\n\r\n- The Blog and the changelog need to be separated, rename News to Changelog and continue doing what you do there.\r\n- Any Blog link on the website should point to medium, this should help bring that higher when users are searching for the node blog.\r\n- Add the Blog link as a top level navigation item to the website https://nodejs.org/en/ so its easier to find\r\n- Remove \"News\" so now there's \"Changelog\" and \"Blog\"",

        "body": "per the recent discussion around the moderation team and importing/exporting the blocklist across our three orgs (nodejs, pkgjs, and nodejs-private), I went ahead and built out a GitHub Action that allows us to import blocklists from one organization to another organization. In practice, this means that if someone is blocked in the `nodejs` org, that block can be imported to the other organizations automatically (presumably on a cron or manual run of the Action, rather than being directly triggered by the block event).\r\n\r\nYou can find the code in [cutenode/action-import-blocklist](https://github.com/cutenode/action-import-blocklist). Implementing it requires a PAT from an account (presumably, in our case, the Node.js bot account) that has the full `admin:org` permissions, which is required by the GitHub API.\r\n\r\n@nodejs/tsc @nodejs/actions want to get feedback on this. My proposal:\r\n\r\n- implement syncing to `pkgjs` and `nodejs-private` by setting up `.github` repositories in both and adding workflows. I'm happy to help with this, but it's pretty trivial.\r\n- alternatively, implement syncing by setting up a `.github` repo in the `nodejs` org, allowing us to have control within the project of where our blocklist is being exported to and not providing `admin:org` tokens to those orgs (pkgjs is notably more permissive).\r\n\r\nquestions I have:\r\n- currently, the Action uses `console.log()` to output what's happening. This does include usernames. Is this okay, or would we want to omit those?\r\n- I'd prefer to move the action to a project-owned organization. Does this belong under `nodejs` or under `pkgjs`?",

It's nice to get as much of that done at once as is possible, and I already manage most of it through DIM. It'd be nice if DIM did that management for me.",

We have two naming schemes side by side - effectively, we've implemented both a flat structure and a tiered structure, and the intersection of those two is messy.\r\n- `active` is particularly problematic since it co-opts existing terminology.\r\n  - `Active` is terminology already adopted by the release working group for LTS releases. `active` in the context of this includes both (Release WG terminology) `current` and `active LTS`, which does not help clarify the already confusing state that we exist within.\r\n- Certain matrix combinations are missing.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support maintenance LTS.\r\n  - Example: there's not a way for someone to say they only support EOL versions.\r\n  - While these examples may not be something we'd immediately consider as valid options, there are potentially scenarios where they'd be useful.

This attack is interesting, because the default diff view in tools like GitHub commits view sometimes hide package-lock.json/shrinkwrap.json changes.\r\n\r\nThis has been written about before, and IIRC has happened, though I don't recall the explicit instance. There's a writeup from Snyk [here](https://snyk.io/blog/why-npm-lockfiles-can-be-a-security-blindspot-for-injecting-malicious-modules/) that goes into some detail about how you could also abuse GitHub's diff review to hide these changes.\r\n\r\n> Since many layers of security has failed if someone has edited your lockfiles,\r\n\r\nI actually disagree with this. I think it's fairly common in module upgrades in open source if you're checking in a lockfile.\r\n\r\nIMO adding `npm audit lockfile` would be great :)\r\n\r\n> If someone does that, then wouldn't the package.json and the lockfile no longer agree? That seems like something npm should be checking.\r\n\r\nhence this RRFC? :P",

In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._\n\nDependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.\n\n[Learn more about migrating to GitHub-native Dependabot][learn]\n\nPlease note that regular `@dependabot` commands do not work on this pull request.\n\n[dashboard]: https://app.dependabot.com/\n[dependabot_page]: https://github.com/wesleytodd/create-package-json/network/updates\n[issues]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/new?assignees=%40dependabot%2Fpreview-migration-reviewers&labels=E%3A+preview-migration&template=migration-issue.md\n[learn]: http://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot\n[new_syntax]: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates\n[org_secrets_url]: https://github.com/settings/secrets/dependabot\n[repo_secrets_url]: https://github.com/wesleytodd/create-package-json/settings/secrets/dependabot\n",

In order to keep getting Dependabot updates, please merge this PR and migrate to GitHub-native Dependabot before then._\n\nDependabot has been fully integrated into GitHub, so you no longer have to install and manage a separate app. This pull request migrates your configuration from Dependabot.com to a config file, using the [new syntax][new_syntax]. When merged, we'll swap out `dependabot-preview` (me) for a new `dependabot` app, and you'll be all set!\n\nWith this change, you'll now use the [Dependabot page in GitHub][dependabot_page], rather than the [Dependabot dashboard][dashboard], to monitor your version updates, and you'll configure Dependabot through the new config file rather than a UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you've got any questions or feedback for us, please let us know by creating an issue in the [dependabot/dependabot-core][issues] repository.\n\n[Learn more about migrating to GitHub-native Dependabot][learn]\n\nPlease note that regular `@dependabot` commands do not work on this pull request.\n\n[dashboard]: https://app.dependabot.com/\n[dependabot_page]: https://github.com/wesleytodd/create-package-json/network/updates\n[issues]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/new?assignees=%40dependabot%2Fpreview-migration-reviewers&labels=E%3A+preview-migration&template=migration-issue.md\n[learn]: http://docs.github.com/code-security/supply-chain-security/upgrading-from-dependabotcom-to-github-native-dependabot\n[new_syntax]: https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates\n[org_secrets_url]: https://github.com/settings/secrets/dependabot\n[repo_secrets_url]: https://github.com/wesleytodd/create-package-json/settings/secrets/dependabot\n",

        "body": "🚨 You need to enable Continuous Integration on Greenkeeper branches of this repository. 🚨\n\nTo enable Greenkeeper, you need to make sure that a [commit status](https://help.github.com/articles/about-statuses/) is reported on all branches. This is required by Greenkeeper because it uses your CI build statuses to figure out when to notify you about breaking changes.\n\nSince we didn’t receive a CI status on the [`greenkeeper/initial`](https://github.com/cutenode/nanoprobe/commits/greenkeeper/initial) branch, it’s possible that you don’t have CI set up yet.\nWe recommend using:\n- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)\n- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)\n- [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/)\n- [CodeShip](https://codeship.com)\n- [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines)\n- [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity)\n- [Buddy](https://buddy.works)\n- [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com)\nBut Greenkeeper will work with every other CI service as well.\n\nIf you _have_ already set up a CI for this repository, you might need to check how it’s configured. Make sure it is set to run on all new branches. If you don’t want it to run on absolutely every branch, you can whitelist branches starting with `greenkeeper/`.\n\nOnce you have installed and configured CI on this repository correctly, you’ll need to re-trigger Greenkeeper’s initial pull request. To do this, please click the 'fix repo' button on [account.greenkeeper.io](https://account.greenkeeper.io).\n",

Happy to help of course.\r\n\r\nI think the big thing is that we'll all want to be ready to help out when _something_ inevitably breaks because `master` is hardcoded. Looking through a very unsophisticated GitHub Search, we do have a lot of `master` in the codebase and some of them definitely seem to be referring to branches, including in python and Markdown. I think Markdown should be an easy fix in the future, but it's something that will need to be done.",

Please describe.**\r\nPresently, making a small contribution to node.js core is particularly challenging. There are a number of contributing factors, but a primary one is simply having to build Node.js from scratch. For someone unfamiliar/new to Node.js, this can be particularly challenging compared to basically anything else in the JavaScript ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be a nice contributor experience enhancement to provide a pre-built image (containerd or Docker?) or some kind of cache that would help alleviate the pain of needing to build *completely* from scratch every single time.\r\n\r\nOne theoretical manifestation of how this _could_ work:\r\n\r\n* Nightly, build a Docker container.\r\n* This Docker container includes all necessary tools / nice-to-haves for building Node.js.\r\n* This Docker container builds Node.js.\r\n\r\nContainers provide some nice benefits: \r\n\r\n* We'd potentially be able to enhance *many* contributors' workflows.\r\n* We'd enable a better experience through cloud-hosted developer environments like Codespaces that have the option to build from a container. \r\n* We could include [node-core-utils](https://github.com/nodejs/node-core-utils) and potentially enhance it further with something like a contributing checklist to ease first-time-contributor or early-contributor burden, effectively automating what's codified in the [PR guidance](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/contributing/pull-requests.md#setting-up-your-local-environment).\r\n\r\nOr, we could do something in the vein of a cloud cache (in the vein of [goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/)). While these require immense work, they are extremely useful and don't require you to run Docker. If there's more interest in this, I'm happy to see what resources I can pull from Microsoft (including potentially open sourcing some things) to enable it.\r\n\r\nEither way, this is a build feature that seems to go in a positive direction that helps both new and existing contributors. Would love thoughts, if there are any.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nDoing nothing: I mean this works but also retains an unnecessary bad experience.",

        "body": "per the recent discussion around the moderation team and importing/exporting the blocklist across our three orgs (nodejs, pkgjs, and nodejs-private), I went ahead and built out a GitHub Action that allows us to import blocklists from one organization to another organization. In practice, this means that if someone is blocked in the `nodejs` org, that block can be imported to the other organizations automatically (presumably on a cron or manual run of the Action, rather than being directly triggered by the block event).\r\n\r\nYou can find the code in [cutenode/action-import-blocklist](https://github.com/cutenode/action-import-blocklist). Implementing it requires a PAT from an account (presumably, in our case, the Node.js bot account) that has the full `admin:org` permissions, which is required by the GitHub API.\r\n\r\n@nodejs/tsc @nodejs/actions want to get feedback on this. My proposal:\r\n\r\n- implement syncing to `pkgjs` and `nodejs-private` by setting up `.github` repositories in both and adding workflows. I'm happy to help with this, but it's pretty trivial.\r\n- alternatively, implement syncing by setting up a `.github` repo in the `nodejs` org, allowing us to have control within the project of where our blocklist is being exported to and not providing `admin:org` tokens to those orgs (pkgjs is notably more permissive).\r\n\r\nOne question I do have: currently, the Action uses `console.log()` to output what's happening. This does include usernames. Is this okay, or would we want to omit those?",

Changing the node namespace aliases for a little more CLI friendliness seems expensive.\r\n\r\nI am talking about those. I'll be frank, I don't think that they're a good API and should not be used in end-user APIs that module maintainers should be using. If changing them is not something that is possible, I'll strongly recommend we abandon using them. ",
