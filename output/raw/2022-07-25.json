People are still being surprised by some relatively important PRs late in the process and sometimes even after they have landed, even though they follow all of our guidelines for waiting time, approvals etc.\r\n\r\nWould it make any sense to try and tag PR/issues as `notable` and send out a daily summary? I suspect we could build a GitHub action to run a query and send out an email.  I'm thinking an email as I don't think GitHub actions can be configured to call out something specific like that in a way that would be visible (at least I have no idea how to do that).\r\n\r\nThe existing `notable-change` label would not be the right thing as it may be added later on if something should be called out in the changelog (based on the description for it) versus a tag added up front.\r\n\r\nThe main ask on collaborators would be to add the `notable` label to appropriate PRs that they open or that they review.\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "## Motivation (\"The Why\")\r\n\r\nToday, I wouldn't be surprised if updating packages is more common than installing packages. The `npm install` DX is pretty good, but `npm update` is _sorely_ lacking to the point that we've collectively [built](https://greenkeeper.io/) [a](https://david-dm.org/) [lot](https://github.com/dependabot) [of](https://snyk.io/) [tools](https://depshield.github.io/#/) to try to help.\r\n\r\nIMO the growth of tooling in this space is a result of the lack of _strong_ update management being a norm in the package management tools we rely on at the root. I'd really like to see npm be able to support the average (modern) user's dependency update requirements, rather than those users reach to third-party tooling to achieve good dependency updates.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n- open up any project older than 1 month and try to update dependencies. it's going to be rough. it should be better.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n#### Current Behaviour\r\n- npm update\r\n  - does something but good luck figuring out if your dependencies are _actually_ as up to date as is possible. they're probably not.\r\n \r\n#### Desired Behaviour\r\n- user runs `npm update`\r\n  - npm does a fresh fetch of dependencies *outside* of what's already resolved in node_modules and pacakge-lock.json\r\n    - tell user what modules are different\r\n    - allow `-y` flag for auto-apply\r\n    - let users interactively update dependencies if the `-y` flag is missing\r\n\r\na different way to look at this:\r\n- GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm update -y`\r\n  - set up to automatically PR changes applied to `package.json` if anything changes\r\n  - I should never have to see a Dependabot PR if this workflow were to run and be merged _prior_ to Dependabot being triggered, since `npm update` would have already updated everything.\r\n\r\nyet another way to look at this:\r\n- Dependabot should be _able to_ adopt `npm update` with limited additional configuration to power their JavaScript update tooling.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/555 is similar but not fundamentally the same as this \r\n",

Because flight costs are insane right now, I cut costs by arriving on the day of the meeting and leaving on the evening of the last day instead of arriving a day before and leaving the day after.\r\n\r\nThe total trip will cost approx. $3,568, so I'm requesting **$1800** for OpenJS' half. Bocoup will cover the rest.",

        "body": "Originally had this as a discussion in https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/43384\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt the Austin Collaborator Summit, there was significant discussion around the need for a more well-defined startup lifecycle with a clearer boundary between the preload phase and the loading/evaluation of the user entry point. The use cases include more reliable handling for APMs, dynamic transpilers, diagnostic tooling, and more. I took the task of working up an initial proposal. Here is that proposal:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Entrypoint Hooks\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Node.js startup process consists of a single bootstrap phase in which the Node.js core internal mechanisms and environment are set up followed by the loading and instantiation of the user-provided entry point script.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nstateDiagram-v2\r\n  state \"Node.js Startup\" as A\r\n  state \"Preloads (sync eval)\" as B\r\n  state \"User entry point script (sync eval)\" as C\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as D\r\n  state \"Process preload and entry point async tasks\" as E\r\n  state \"Run event loop\" as F\r\n  [*] --> A\r\n  A --> B\r\n  B --> C\r\n  C --> D\r\n  D --> E\r\n  E --> F\r\n  F --> [*]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe User Entry point here is the script that is provided as the argument to the node binary (e.g. node foo.js, foo.js is the User Entry point).\r\n\r\nHistorically with Node.js, there have always been scenarios where it is desirable to load and run code before the User Entry point performs any actions. This can be accomplished with several methods:\r\n\r\n* **Require-first**: By strategically positioning require and import statements at the beginning of the User Entry point so that they are loaded and evaluated before anything else. This is the mechanism used typically by many Node.js APMs.\r\n* **Wrapper/Loader**: By using an alternative user entry point that ensures that certain code is loaded and evaluated first before the actual user entry point is loaded. This is the mechanism used typically by certain test frameworks, serverless environments like lambda.\r\n* **Preloads**: By using the Node.js -r command-line argument, Node.js can be instructed to load and evaluate one or more CommonJS scripts synchronously before loading and evaluating the user entry point script. This is used, for instance, by tools like Node.js Clinic to preload diagnostic tooling into the Node.js process.\r\n* **Module Loaders**: By providing an alternative module loader implementation using the still experimental loader API, it is possible to execute startup code the first time a module is loaded – including the user entry point module. This is the mechanism used by tools such as ts-node, for instance.\r\n\r\nWhile each of these have historically been effective, they each suffer from a number of limitations, not the least of which is the lack of a clear separation between the execution of the preload code and the user entry point. Take, for instance, the following example:\r\n\r\nImagine a preload script with a simple one-line of code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// preload.js\r\nsetImmediate(() => console.log('preload');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a User Entrypoint script with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// entry.js\r\nconsole.log('entrypoint');\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow run the node binary as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode -r ./preload.js entry.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order of the statements printed will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nentrypoint\r\npreload\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because while the preload script does run before entry point script, it schedules async activity that does not get invoked until after the event loop has started, after the entry point script has been evaluated. While waiting for the preload script to complete, a lot of user code can run.\r\n\r\nIn other words, while there is a clear boundary at which preload can begin, there is no such boundary for when preload *completes*. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for establishing a clearer lifecycle boundary\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nIn the proposed new model, a new Entrypoint Hook phase is introduced into the Node.js startup following the completion of the bootstrap. During the Entrypoint Hook phase, one or more preload scripts can be loaded and evaluated in a user-defined order, in precisely the same way that preload scripts (using the -r argument) are loaded except for one very important distinction: Immediately after loading and evaluating these preload scripts, the Node.js event loop will be started to allow any asynchronous operations initiated by those to be run to completion. When there are no further async tasks for that first run of the event loop to complete, the entry point hook phase of the bootstrap will be considered to be complete, the event loop will be reset, and the user entry point will be loaded and evaluated, continuing the Node.js startup just as it does today. If there are no preload scripts to run, this entire new phase is skipped.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nstateDiagram-v2\r\n  state \"Node.js Startup\" as A\r\n  state \"Preloads (sync eval)\" as B\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as C\r\n  state \"Process preload async tasks\" as D\r\n  state \"Stop event loop\" as E\r\n  state \"User entry point script (sync eval)\" as F\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as G\r\n  state \"Process entry point async tasks\" as H\r\n  state \"Run event loop\" as I\r\n  state \"Entry point hook phase\" as J\r\n  state \"User entry point run phase\" as K\r\n  [*] --> A\r\n  A --> B\r\n  state J {\r\n    B --> C\r\n    C --> D\r\n    D --> E\r\n    E --> F\r\n  }\r\n  state K {\r\n    F --> G\r\n    G --> H\r\n    H --> I\r\n    I --> [*]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this approach, the preload scripts run during the Entrypoint Hook phase are permitted to fully complete and can alter the user entry point before it begins.\r\n\r\nImportantly, at the end of the entry point hook phase, there are no pending async tasks of any kind carrying over into the evaluation of the user entry point script. The entry point hooks may allocate handles that persist across the boundary between phases (e.g. network handles, file descriptors, etc) but those will have no pending i/o by the end of the phase.\r\n\r\n## Use Case: Serverless\r\nIn the serverless use case, a serverless host environment can use the entry point hook phase to load any supporting framework code and initialization process it needs before completing the actual user entry point script. \r\n\r\n## Use Case: APMs/Diagnostic Tools\r\nIn the APM use case, diagnostic tools can use the entry point hook phase to load any diagnostic instrumentation it needs to prepare, even if that tooling is initialized asynchronously (e.g. to query file system or network for license or configuration data)\r\n\r\n## Use Case: Dynamic Transpilers\r\nBecause the entry point hook is guaranteed to run to completion before the start of the user entry point, they can be used to implement dynamic transpilation of the user entry point before it completes. For instance, a TypeScript entry point hook can transpile a typescript file passed in as the user entry point and trigger Node.js to load and execute the compiled JavaScript result rather than trying to run the typescript file that was provided:\r\n\r\n## What about startup time? Cold starts?\r\nEntrypoint Hook scripts will have an impact on Node.js binary startup time when used. There are, fortunately, mechanisms for mitigating such costs. It would be possible, for instance, to capture a snapshot of the preloads such that loading and initial evaluation cost is reduced in exactly the same way that we have created snapshots of the Node.js bootstrap and are working to create snapshots of the user entry point. Preloads, however, are not trivial and effort will need to be made to ensure a minimal performance cost.\r\n\r\n## What is the relationship to Loaders?\r\nPluggable loaders are invoked as a result of `require()` or `import` (static or dynamic). The entry point hooks run once immediately upon start of the Node.js process or worker thread startup, and that is it. As such, they serve two entirely different purposes. ",

I believe the (high level) avenue to that functionality which was proposed through the concept of entrypoint hooks was for Node.js to look for a system TS and kill the process if there wasn't one. This would mean we don't have to ship support for TS nor care about the version that's running, ideally. Could/would loaders be a good fit for that?",

        "body": "One of the discussions at the Node.js Collaborator Summit in Austin last week was about the strategy of vendoring in Node.js ecosystem modules to distribute with the `node` binary. The proposal discussed was to introduce a new `vendor:` or `vendored:` specifier prefix to access such modules included in the distribution. This issue is for discussing that.\r\n\r\nThis issue was prompted by discussions on the @nodejs/tooling team.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of this introduction, we'll assume the namespace is `vendor:`, but that name still needs to be decided on.\r\n\r\n## The Proposal ...\r\n\r\nThe `vendor:` namespace provides a clear namespace for exposing vendored-in dependencies distributed with the Node.js binary. For instance, assuming some arbitrary npm module `foo` that Node.js decided, for whatever reason, to bundle and distribute with the binary, the module specifier `vendor:foo` can be used to load that module from within the node binary as opposed to searching for it in the `node_modules` path.\r\n\r\nFor a more practical example, Node.js currently bundles the `undici` HTTP client to provide the implementation of the `fetch()` API but does not expose the full `undici` module API. If Node.js did decide to expose the full `undici` module underlying the fetch implementation, it could decide to do so, using the `vendor:undici` specifier.\r\n\r\nModules exported within the `vendor:` namespace are *not* Node.js built-in modules. They are simply ecosystem modules that are distributed with the node binary. These modules are:\r\n\r\n* Developed independently of Node.js core.\r\n* May or may not be developed by the Node.js project under the OpenJS Foundation\r\n* May or may not have been developed to the same standards/guidelines as the Node.js project (for instance, they might not make use of the Node.js internal errors or primordials mechanisms).\r\n* May or may not be within the nodejs GitHub Organization\r\n\r\nBugs in the vendored module are not considered to be bugs in Node.js (this is similar to how we treat bugs in npm, for instance, which is also distributed with the Node.js binary).\r\n\r\n## Why would we do this?\r\nSome modules are used by nearly every one, provide core functionality needed by Node.js itself, and are so important to the ecosystem that bundling them just makes sense. Many of these are *already* bundled with the node.js distribution via dependencies to the npm client. Whether or not there is sufficient justification to include these in the distribution itself is part of this conversation. Specifically, what is our decision matrix for accepting these?\r\n\r\n## Small Core!!?\r\nAdding a vendor module does not increase the LTS supported core API surface area of Node.js, and most of the modules that will be considered for bundling are *already distributed with Node.js as dependencies of the npm client*.\r\n\r\n## What about versions?\r\nYes, vendored modules might end up out of date with what is published on the npmjs registry. Node.js will make a best effort to keep the dependencies up to date but it is expected to be common that a vendored version will be older than the version available on npm. If an application wants to make sure that it is using the latest version and not the one bundled in Node.js, then it can continue to list that module as a dependency in its package.json and use the non-prefixed specifier when importing/requiring the module.\r\n\r\n## What about LTS?\r\nNode.js will support vendored modules only in the sense that Node.js will ensure that non-breaking or security updates to vendored modules will be handled as part of LTS. For instance, if there is a security release for a version of a vendored module, then a new Node.js release with the updated version will be provided. Semver-major and some semver-minor releases to those vendored modules, however, will not be updated in LTS versions, following the spirit of our existing LTS contract. The Node.js release team will have final discretion on details relating to the handling of updates to vendored modules in LTS releases.\r\n\r\n## What can go into `vendor:` ?\r\nAdding a new vendor: module is a big decision that can have significant ecosystem impact, it also can have the effect of greatly increasing the size of the node binary distribution. Great care and consideration must be taken in the decision to add a module. A defined set of criteria must be established. These can include the number of dependencies in the ecosystem, considerations about the quality of the code, desire of the maintainers of the code to have the module bundled, generalized utility of the module to the largest number of use cases, and utility of the module to Node.js' own use (e.g. we bundle undici because we directly depend on undici for fetch(), exposing it in vendor: would be optional but also fairly straightforward without introducing a significant additional burden).\r\n\r\nStrong consideration should be given to limiting vendored modules to only those that have been contributed to either the Node.js project (the way, for instance, undici has been) or are covered under the OpenJS Foundation open governance model. Especially important is that vendored modules are not maintained by a single source or a single decision maker. In fact, as part of the discussion as to whether a module should be added to vendor:, it is reasonable to request that the module is contributed to Node.js or to the OpenJS Foundation as a first step, and that the project have at least 3+ core contributors with commit/write/publish access..\r\n\r\n## Why `vendor:foo` and not `@node/foo` or `vendor/foo` or `node:foo`?\r\nThere is already a `vendor` module on npm. Using a specifier such as `vendor/foo` would directly conflict with that existing module. Using any other /-prefix could potentially suffer from the same constraint. It's doable, yes, but using the :-prefix avoids this challenge.\r\n\r\nUsing `node:foo` would run the risk of a vendored module being confused with an official Node.js built-in module.\r\n\r\nUsing something like `@node` could be problematic if the module that is being vendored already has an @-prefix. For example, if we have a module like `@abc/foo`, then `@node/@abc/foo` is rather clumsy and awkward. `vendor:@abc/foo` is clearer and less awkward (at least to me)\r\n\r\n## Vulnerabilities\r\nThe risk of shipping additional vulnerabilities in Node.js exists. A few mitigation must be put in place to avoid such risk:\r\n* Processes to update those dependencies in LTS releases if/when a vulnerabilities in them is disclosed\r\n* An API to query which version of said module is being shipped within Node.js (e.g. `process.versions.vendor` or equivalent)\r\n* Before vendoring, the frequency of vulnerabilities in a module should be considered and evaluated. For example, something that consistently ships vulnerability releases might not be a good fit for vendoring due to the increased workload on releasers and increased churn for end-users.\r\n\r\n/cc @bcoe @darcyclarke @nodejs/tooling ",

I've seen many organizations float internal patches of third-party modules either for feature reasons (adding/removing features) or for security reasons (fix a bug until a release is shipped). Heck, [patch-package](https://www.google.com/search?q=npm+patch+vendored+module&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) has 1m weekly downloads, which is high for that kind of module. It would likely be smart to provide such an option if we do go down this path. Such an interface might also be a good mechanism for Node.js itself to still maintain control and be able to ship fixes for vendored modules faster.",

        "body": "Originally had this as a discussion in https://github.com/nodejs/node/discussions/43384\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt the Austin Collaborator Summit, there was significant discussion around the need for a more well-defined startup lifecycle with a clearer boundary between the preload phase and the loading/evaluation of the user entry point. The use cases include more reliable handling for APMs, dynamic transpilers, diagnostic tooling, and more. I took the task of working up an initial proposal. Here is that proposal:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Entrypoint Hooks\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Node.js startup process consists of a single bootstrap phase in which the Node.js core internal mechanisms and environment are set up followed by the loading and instantiation of the user-provided entry point script.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nstateDiagram-v2\r\n  state \"Node.js Startup\" as A\r\n  state \"Preloads (sync eval)\" as B\r\n  state \"User entry point script (sync eval)\" as C\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as D\r\n  state \"Process preload and entry point async tasks\" as E\r\n  state \"Run event loop\" as F\r\n  [*] --> A\r\n  A --> B\r\n  B --> C\r\n  C --> D\r\n  D --> E\r\n  E --> F\r\n  F --> [*]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe User Entry point here is the script that is provided as the argument to the node binary (e.g. node foo.js, foo.js is the User Entry point).\r\n\r\nHistorically with Node.js, there have always been scenarios where it is desirable to load and run code before the User Entry point performs any actions. This can be accomplished with several methods:\r\n\r\n* **Require-first**: By strategically positioning require and import statements at the beginning of the User Entry point so that they are loaded and evaluated before anything else. This is the mechanism used typically by many Node.js APMs.\r\n* **Wrapper/Loader**: By using an alternative user entry point that ensures that certain code is loaded and evaluated first before the actual user entry point is loaded. This is the mechanism used typically by certain test frameworks, serverless environments like lambda.\r\n* **Preloads**: By using the Node.js -r command-line argument, Node.js can be instructed to load and evaluate one or more CommonJS scripts synchronously before loading and evaluating the user entry point script. This is used, for instance, by tools like Node.js Clinic to preload diagnostic tooling into the Node.js process.\r\n* **Module Loaders**: By providing an alternative module loader implementation using the still experimental loader API, it is possible to execute startup code the first time a module is loaded – including the user entry point module. This is the mechanism used by tools such as ts-node, for instance.\r\n\r\nWhile each of these have historically been effective, they each suffer from a number of limitations, not the least of which is the lack of a clear separation between the execution of the preload code and the user entry point. Take, for instance, the following example:\r\n\r\nImagine a preload script with a simple one-line of code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// preload.js\r\nsetImmediate(() => console.log('preload');\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a User Entrypoint script with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// entry.js\r\nconsole.log('entrypoint');\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow run the node binary as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode -r ./preload.js entry.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe order of the statements printed will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nentrypoint\r\npreload\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because while the preload script does run before entry point script, it schedules async activity that does not get invoked until after the event loop has started, after the entry point script has been evaluated. While waiting for the preload script to complete, a lot of user code can run.\r\n\r\nIn other words, while there is a clear boundary at which preload can begin, there is no such boundary for when preload *completes*. \r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for establishing a clearer lifecycle boundary\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nIn the proposed new model, a new Entrypoint Hook phase is introduced into the Node.js startup following the completion of the bootstrap. During the Entrypoint Hook phase, one or more preload scripts can be loaded and evaluated in a user-defined order, in precisely the same way that preload scripts (using the -r argument) are loaded except for one very important distinction: Immediately after loading and evaluating these preload scripts, the Node.js event loop will be started to allow any asynchronous operations initiated by those to be run to completion. When there are no further async tasks for that first run of the event loop to complete, the entry point hook phase of the bootstrap will be considered to be complete, the event loop will be reset, and the user entry point will be loaded and evaluated, continuing the Node.js startup just as it does today. If there are no preload scripts to run, this entire new phase is skipped.\r\n\r\n```mermaid\r\nstateDiagram-v2\r\n  state \"Node.js Startup\" as A\r\n  state \"Preloads (sync eval)\" as B\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as C\r\n  state \"Process preload async tasks\" as D\r\n  state \"Stop event loop\" as E\r\n  state \"User entry point script (sync eval)\" as F\r\n  state \"Start event loop\" as G\r\n  state \"Process entry point async tasks\" as H\r\n  state \"Run event loop\" as I\r\n  state \"Entry point hook phase\" as J\r\n  state \"User entry point run phase\" as K\r\n  [*] --> A\r\n  A --> B\r\n  state J {\r\n    B --> C\r\n    C --> D\r\n    D --> E\r\n    E --> F\r\n  }\r\n  state K {\r\n    F --> G\r\n    G --> H\r\n    H --> I\r\n    I --> [*]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this approach, the preload scripts run during the Entrypoint Hook phase are permitted to fully complete and can alter the user entry point before it begins.\r\n\r\nImportantly, at the end of the entry point hook phase, there are no pending async tasks of any kind carrying over into the evaluation of the user entry point script. The entry point hooks may allocate handles that persist across the boundary between phases (e.g. network handles, file descriptors, etc) but those will have no pending i/o by the end of the phase.\r\n\r\n## Use Case: Serverless\r\nIn the serverless use case, a serverless host environment can use the entry point hook phase to load any supporting framework code and initialization process it needs before completing the actual user entry point script. \r\n\r\n## Use Case: APMs/Diagnostic Tools\r\nIn the APM use case, diagnostic tools can use the entry point hook phase to load any diagnostic instrumentation it needs to prepare, even if that tooling is initialized asynchronously (e.g. to query file system or network for license or configuration data)\r\n\r\n## Use Case: Dynamic Transpilers\r\nBecause the entry point hook is guaranteed to run to completion before the start of the user entry point, they can be used to implement dynamic transpilation of the user entry point before it completes. For instance, a TypeScript entry point hook can transpile a typescript file passed in as the user entry point and trigger Node.js to load and execute the compiled JavaScript result rather than trying to run the typescript file that was provided:\r\n\r\n## What about startup time? Cold starts?\r\nEntrypoint Hook scripts will have an impact on Node.js binary startup time when used. There are, fortunately, mechanisms for mitigating such costs. It would be possible, for instance, to capture a snapshot of the preloads such that loading and initial evaluation cost is reduced in exactly the same way that we have created snapshots of the Node.js bootstrap and are working to create snapshots of the user entry point. Preloads, however, are not trivial and effort will need to be made to ensure a minimal performance cost.\r\n\r\n## What is the relationship to Loaders?\r\nPluggable loaders are invoked as a result of `require()` or `import` (static or dynamic). The entry point hooks run once immediately upon start of the Node.js process or worker thread startup, and that is it. As such, they serve two entirely different purposes. ",

I believe it's often not easy to step back and not to ask for something to be changed when it's not necessary but it feels \"right\". I personally am definitely also guilty of this.\r\n\r\n@nodejs/tsc @nodejs/collaborators please weight in as this mainly is about all of us. Please also share if you feel similar / disagree with my view.\r\n\r\n### What is the feature you are proposing to solve the problem?\r\n\r\nIn many cases we could likely have a follow-up PR on our own and get things done faster and have a nicer developer experience.\r\nAsking for things that are not required just often does not feel right to me as it makes it difficult to contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nThere are likely more ways to do this, I just wanted to quickly write this down and get early opinions.",

It is _largely_ a copy/paste from electron/electron's [styleguide.md](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/styleguide.md), with some changes.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this is not to have it as an immediately enforceable, but rather to have it be planted as the guide that we'll eventually fully enforce on all documentation that it can be enforced on (some documentation, like native APIs, it can only be partially enforced on).\r\n\r\nLanding this and, eventually, having all of our documentation written in this style should allows us the ability to use [docs-parser](https://github.com/electron/docs-parser) which produces a high-quality JSON output of markdown documentation written as the style guide defines. This would allow the DefinitelyTyped people to produce higher quality type definitions, potentially even just using Electron's [typescript-definitions](https://github.com/electron/typescript-definitions) tooling that parses docs-parser output into `.d.ts` files.\r\n\r\nThere are other, less objective benefits:\r\n- highly consistent authoring experience that provides a consistent framework for writing and reviewing documentation\r\n- more digestible documentation for end-users, structuring all documentation in a hierarchy that's consistent across pages while still being specific enough to provide meaningful context regardless of content\r\n\r\nWorth noting, I also created https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/32206 some time ago, and this is one step towards that as a reality. In doing so, I also created [bnb/node-docs-parser](https://github.com/bnb/node-docs-parser) which snapshotted a few examples from the Node.js documentation at the time I created it and provided an example of what those documents would look like if they were migrated. While it's been a pandemic worth of time since I last worked on that repo and some of the docs have been updated (querystring in particular is much more consistent!), the documents in `/docs/api` are still pretty close to what the \"translated\" versions would look like if you want a reference.\r\n\r\nchanges to the styleguide.md from the e/e version include:\r\n\r\n- updating the name (`Electron` > `Node.js`)\r\n- removing references to `markdownlint`\r\n  - given that Electron and docs-parser use markdownlint, it might make sense to migrate to it.\r\n- removed a TODO above the linter rules, noting that they should be checked against what the electron/electron markdown parser checks for.\r\n  - potentially worth investigating finding a middle ground and both using one set of tooling.\r\n- tweaked examples to fit Node.js. As we build out the documentation to fit this style guide, we should update these examples to me more thorough.\r\n- removed one example under the \"function signature\" heading on line 169, as I'm not immediately familiar of a class that has the same name as its module and can be used as an example. Happy to re-add this when I find a good example.\r\n  - here's the original text, for reference: \r\n    - > For example, the methods of the `Session` class under the `session` module must use `ses` as the `objectName`.\r\n- removed a reference on line 181 to Electron's cookie API custom sturcutre. Happy to re-add this back in once we've got our own custom structures added.\r\n- added backticks to line 228 where they weren't in the Electron documentation. I believe the backticks are allowed/required, but should double check just to make sure that's a correct assertion before merging.\r\n\r\na few things to discuss:\r\n- js code linting\r\n  - Electron's standardized on StandardJS and has proper tooling for it, including [standard-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-markdown). While I'm personally fine with this, I assume the Node.js project would want a different linter solution documented.\r\n  - happy to change the text on lines 55-56 referencing this if we don't want to keep this.\r\n- I'm not sure if we have platform-specific functionality. If we don't and never plan on doing so, happy to remove line 194-203.\r\n- how we want to approach inline YAML changelogs. Particularly, it was raised that it would be nice to have in Markdown but it may also become burdensome for those who backport, which is definitely not something I'd want to see.\r\n  - potential solution here is to document an additional markdown structure for changelogs and then have a small tool convert YAML into that Markdown structure as a build step.\r\n  - I'm unopinionated on what a solution is here, but ideally, we will *eventually* not have any YAML frontmatter.\r\n\r\nand just for context, the ideal next steps _after_ this PR lands would be to begin incrementally migrating documentation to fit the style guide.",

For example:\r\n\r\n> Members of our leadership groups must also conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. Some general guidelines include:\r\n\r\nThe juxtaposition of \"must...conduct themselves\" with \"general guidelines include\" leaves things very open to interpretation. (If that is inevitable then let's acknowledge it.)  There is a \"must\" requirement, but then a \"general guidelines\" list. \r\n\r\n## Unclear responsibilities\r\n\r\nPeople are told to report \"leadership acting outside of the expectations\" to the moderation team. That makes sense on one level, in that reporting a violation by a TSC member to the TSC has obvious problems. But (going out on a limb a bit by speaking on behalf of @nodejs/moderation team--members of that team, please comment with contrary opinions if you disagree!) moderation team doesn't consider member expectations as part of their purview. Moderation team considers itself responsible for the Code of Conduct.\r\n\r\n## Unclear sanctions\r\n\r\nEven if moderation team is responsible for enforcing member expectations, it's not clear what the tools they have are. It does not seem that the (typically serious) sanctions available for Code of Conduct violations would always be useful or applicable here.",

If including `--fix` is a desired approach, feel free to close this PR.",

        "body": "I'd like to propose a new `\"source\"` condition in the `\"exports\"` field.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Node.js applications tend to assume that what is published to npm and imported from `node_modules` should be readable JS code and generally isn't minified and optimized by default.\r\n\r\nIn Node.js this is because minification and optimization doesn't provide a huge benefit for runtime performance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when running JS code in the browser, minification and single-file optimizations are an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nWhen specifying a `\"browser\"` exports condition in the package.json, there's then a sort of implicit assumption that one should reference a minified source file, in contrast to an unminified version for Node.js.\r\n\r\nThis disparity is something package authors often have to wrestle with in making individual decisions for environments in this way.\r\n\r\nA `\"source\"` condition would be defined as the uncompiled version of the code that runs the original source directly, useful for debugging workflows. By permitting packages to define this condition, we are encouraging packages to publish their original sources beyond just questionable source maps support, but actually in a form that can allow debugging back to the original readable code in all environments, while still being able to publish optimized JS code to npm.\r\n\r\nThe existing `\"development\"` and `\"production\"` conditions don't capture this condition because they refer to the execution mode, not the execution performance. Things like single-file-optimizations, minification and removing comments can be seen as optimizations that apply to both builds.\r\n\r\nBy using a `\"source\"` condition over a `\"optimized\"` condition or otherwise, we make it clear that the default mode for sources should really be to publish the most optimized version, and that switching back into a source condition is something that is done under special circumstances.\r\n\r\nI've found this pattern incredibly useful for local development, running local tests via both `node test/test.js` and `node -C source test/test.js` when source maps are not sufficient to trace the error, and live code editing to add comments or further analysis is needed directly on the original sources to track the bug.\r\n\r\n//cc @nodejs/modules ",

        "body": "> I would be grateful for links / resources further.\r\n\r\nI believe @ljharb was referring to this RFC which does not do exactly what he/I would want, but conceptually gets close: https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519\r\n\r\n> Can you explain how npm should handle this in more detail, or link to the source? \r\n\r\nConceptually, I believe that the npm Registry should allow you to publish multiple distributions (the specific name doesn't matter, distributions is just a somewhat accurate representation) for the same version. For example:\r\n\r\n- I have module `x`\r\n- I ship `x@1.2.3`\r\n- I decide I want `x@1.2.3`'s `default` distribution to be the smallest possible package so it requires the least disk space and data over the wire as is possible.\r\n- However, I want my users to be able to have `x@1.2.3` with tests so they can run them. I would publish a `x@1.2.3` `with-tests` distribution that would have the minified version with tests.\r\n- I could also publish a `x@1.2.3` `with-tests-and-source` distribution that includes both my tests and the source code that `default` was built from.\r\n\r\nThis has a some nice benefits:\r\n\r\n- There can be _multiple_ variants provided by maintainers who want to give that to their users\r\n- It allows smaller packages without losing the fidelity of including tests/source/whatever else you want to include\r\n- It's additive to the ecosystem - it doesn't need to change what we already do/what we already publish\r\n\r\nMy personal perspective is that enabling this within the existing publishing structure (as this PR aims to do) does solve the problem but in a way that is less optimal than the underlying platform itself supporting the use case.\r\n\r\nDefinitely want to note that I'm not blocking this or trying to toss out the proposed solution, just want to surface my recommendation that this be done at the registry level rather than the Node.js level for what I think would be a more robust solution to the (extremely valid!) problem.",

By permitting packages to define this condition, we are encouraging packages to publish their original sources beyond just questionable source maps support, but actually in a form that can allow debugging back to the original readable code in all environments, while still being able to publish optimized JS code to npm.\r\n\r\nThe existing `\"development\"` and `\"production\"` conditions don't capture this condition because they refer to the execution mode, not the execution performance. Things like single-file-optimizations, minification and removing comments can be seen as optimizations that apply to both builds.\r\n\r\nBy using a `\"source\"` condition over a `\"optimized\"` condition or otherwise, we make it clear that the default mode for sources should really be to publish the most optimized version, and that switching back into a source condition is something that is done under special circumstances.\r\n\r\nI've found this pattern incredibly useful for local development, running local tests via both `node test/test.js` and `node -C source test/test.js` when source maps are not sufficient to trace the error, and live code editing to add comments or further analysis is needed directly on the original sources to track the bug.\r\n\r\n//cc @nodejs/modules ",

Specifically, I think this exact thing will dramatically increase total bundle sizes resulting in both increased size on disk for end-users (I care more about the total disk usage on personal/work computers, not servers where stuff is running) *and* it will globally increase install times.\r\n\r\nIMO the issues I mentioned are 100% because the npm registry _does not_ provide a way to offer multiple distributions of the same version of a package (I've had this discussion many times with @ljharb, begging him to drop tests from his modules). I would genuinely love it if they did (then I wouldn't have to have @ljharb's and others' tests in my `node_modules`, but they could have them if they wanted to). I'm concerned about Node.js (or any other runtime/platform!) trying to solve this with features because it's fundamentally a workaround for a registry issue, and I'd hope that instead of shipping something that works around the problem we can convince the problem to be solved at the source of it.\r\n\r\nIMO this isn't a bad feature and I wouldn't be upset if it shipped, but I think there are more direct solutions that are better for the ecosystem *and* don't introduce features that we'll have deprecate/change/teach not to use as a part of best practices later.",

This will consume the Docker image I've built out (pending https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 on moving it into nodejs/devcontainer) that will be built and published nightly.\r\n\r\nThese should add a relatively low maintenance burden - the `Dockerfile` is literally two LOC (most of the work for this is done in the nodejs/devcontainer repo!) and the `.devcontainer.json` is effectively a configuration file that represents some settings. It could be stripped down or more thoroughly built out if folks want, though I'd generally like to request that we err on configuring for a broader audience than just project members (think the audience at a Code and Learn event) while also serving ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not land until https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 lands.",

All modules rely on it, Node.js itself uses it for versioning, and it's currently sitting at 193m downloads last week, and 187m downloads the week prior - with a growth of 6m downloads in a *week*.\r\n\r\nDuring both of the tooling sessions at the collaborator's summit, we discussed vendoring semver. There _seemed_ to be general consensus, but I wanted to create an issue to begin the discussion.\r\n\r\nDiscussion points:\r\n- Should we do this?\r\n  - General consensus from the collaborator summit seems to be that this is an acceptable addition.\r\n- Would the semver repo be able to be moved into the Node.js org?\r\n  - There seems to be a willingness/interest in this from the current maintainers.\r\n- How does this get included?\r\n  - There was a general consensus / a lot of discussion around having a `vendored` scope. This does seem to be an important discussion that should be explored and expanded separately and simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's a few more points here, but wanted to get this down so we can begin to have it.",

        "body": "## Motivation (\"The Why\")\r\n\r\nToday, I wouldn't be surprised if updating packages is more common than installing packages. The `npm install` DX is pretty good, but `npm update` is _sorely_ lacking to the point that we've collectively [built](https://greenkeeper.io/) [a](https://david-dm.org/) [lot](https://github.com/dependabot) [of](https://snyk.io/) [tools](https://depshield.github.io/#/) to try to help.\r\n\r\nIMO the growth of tooling in this space is a result of the lack of _strong_ update management being a norm in the package management tools we rely on at the root. I'd really like to see npm be able to support the average (modern) user's dependency update requirements, rather than those users reach to third-party tooling to achieve good dependency updates.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n- open up any project older than 1 month and try to update dependencies. it's going to be rough. it should be better.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n#### Current Behaviour\r\n- npm update\r\n  - does something but good luck figuring out if your dependencies are _actually_ as up to date as is possible. they're probably not.\r\n \r\n#### Desired Behaviour\r\n- user runs `npm update`\r\n  - npm does a fresh fetch of dependencies *outside* of what's already resolved in node_modules and pacakge-lock.json\r\n    - tell user what modules are different\r\n    - allow `-y` flag for auto-apply\r\n    - let users interactively update dependencies if the `-y` flag is missing\r\n\r\na different way to look at this:\r\n- GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm update -y`\r\n  - set up to automatically PR changes applied to `package.json` if anything changes\r\n  - I should never have to see a Dependabot PR if this workflow were to run and be merged _prior_ to Dependabot being triggered, since `npm update` would have already updated everything.\r\n\r\nyet another way to look at this:\r\n- Dependabot should be _able to_ adopt `npm update` with limited additional configuration to power their JavaScript update tooling.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/555 is similar but not fundamentally the same as this \r\n",

This will consume the Docker image I've built out (pending https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 on moving it into nodejs/devcontainer) that will be built and published nightly.\r\n\r\nThese should add a relatively low maintenance burden - the `Dockerfile` is literally two LOC (most of the work for this is done in the nodejs/devcontainer repo!) and the `.devcontainer.json` is effectively a configuration file that represents some settings. It could be stripped down or more thoroughly built out if folks want, though I'd generally like to request that we err on configuring for a broader audience than just project members (think the audience at a Code and Learn event) while also serving ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not land until https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 lands.",

        "body": "this PR adds two metadata files: \r\n\r\n1. `./.devcontainer/.devcontainer.json` provides metadata to GitHub Codespaces and other tools (like Docker Desktop's preview [Developer Environments](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/dev-environments/) feature) about how to build and configure a developer environment.\r\n2. `./.devcontainer/Dockerfile` a very simple `Dockerfile` that the `.devcontainer.json` file uses to build from. This will consume the Docker image I've built out (pending https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 on moving it into nodejs/devcontainer) that will be built and published nightly.\r\n\r\nThese should add a relatively low maintenance burden - the `Dockerfile` is literally two LOC (most of the work for this is done in the nodejs/devcontainer repo!) and the `.devcontainer.json` is effectively a configuration file that represents some settings. It could be stripped down or more thoroughly built out if folks want, though I'd generally like to request that we err on configuring for a broader audience than just project members (think the audience at a Code and Learn event) while also serving ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not land until https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 lands.",

I am +1 on both of those points.",

This will consume the Docker image I've built out (pending https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 on moving it into nodejs/devcontainer) that will be built and published nightly.\r\n\r\nThese should add a relatively low maintenance burden - the `Dockerfile` is literally two LOC (most of the work for this is done in the nodejs/devcontainer repo!) and the `.devcontainer.json` is effectively a configuration file that represents some settings. It could be stripped down or more thoroughly built out if folks want, though I'd generally like to request that we err on configuring for a broader audience than just project members (think the audience at a Code and Learn event) while also serving ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis PR should not land until https://github.com/nodejs/admin/issues/641 lands.",

Unfortunately around that time I was feeling pretty drained and was beginning to feel the need to job search. I've now job searched, quit my job, and am on a brief mental health recovery period that was graciously agreed to by my new employer before working again.\n\nThis is maybe like 5 hours of work from being complete, not including figuring out who in the org owns the Node.js Docker Hub org and setting that governance up.\n\nCodespaces *does* work now, but kinda sucks as you mention. The Docker image has been transferred into the org but isn't being built/deployed presently. I'll be able to spend some time on this in the back half of June! Also happy to pair on it at Summit if anyone would like that. ",

        "body": "In #5995 we introduced Rollup as an alternative bundler. This issue is to track remaining work:\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n - [ ] [ALL] Bundling of workers is not working anymore with [our plugin](https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend/blob/dev/build-scripts/rollup-plugins/worker-plugin.js) since we switched to Webpack 5 syntax.\r\n       ```ts\r\n       const worker = new Worker(new URL(\"./markdown_worker\", import.meta.url));\r\n       ```\r\n    - [WDS only] This works if we add the extension to worker files. It requires:\r\n      - Web Workers need to be on same domain, so we need to proxy all files via frontend. Possible with [this core branch](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/compare/frontend-dev) and update index.html to import from `/_dev_frontend/src/entrypoints/app.ts` etc.\r\n      - This is module based so update `new Worker` with `{type: 'module'}` as 2nd arg`\r\n      - Ran into issues with bundling the XSS package for markdown. Data filter worked fine.\r\n      - Would also require to update webpack to use modules for web workers in dev mode or maybe add `IS_WDS` constant.\r\n - [ ] [Custom Panel] Update how we load custom panel entrypoint in empty iframe when bundling with Rollup and using ES5.\r\n - [ ] [Hassio] Supervisor build needs to load the SystemJS loader when loading the ES5 build\r\n - [ ] [ALL] ES5 build is broken. RegeneratorRuntime is not set on window in compatibility.js.\r\n - [x] [ALL] `new Fuse()` doesn't work. In Rollup object is `{default:constructor}` #6012\r\n - [x] [Rollup config] Rollup config handling of `bundle.ignorePackages` + `bundle.emptyPackages` doesn't work (to test: build demo -> see app.js)  #6007\r\n - [x] [Gallery] remove using dynamic `require()` call to list a dir and its files because Rollup doesn't support it #6203\r\n - [x] [ALL] Update check to serve which version to rely on support of `import()` function instead of support of `modules`. (app already done)\r\n - [ ] Check if we need to replace `lit-virtualizer/lib/uni-virtualizer/lib/polyfillLoaders/EventTarget.js` like we did for Webpack (`src/resources/EventTarget-ponyfill.js`)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Clean up\r\n - [x] [build-scripts] Move `babel.js` options into `bundle.js` #5997\r\n - [x] [build-scripts] Any constant in `build-scripts` that refers packages with `require.resolve` needs to be returned from a function #5997\r\n - [x] [build-scripts] Prefix app variables in `build-scripts/paths.js` with `app_` #5997\r\n\r\n## Improve\r\n - [ ] [App] split out authorize, onboarding and core into their own bundle config so they don't mess with the chunks of app. \r\n - [ ] [App] Clean up chunks with [manualChunks](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#manualchunks) (first split out stuff)\r\n - [x] [Rollup worker plugin] add the worker source code to the Rollup watchlist for in dev #6034\r\n - [x] [Rollup worker plugin] add `terser` to default plugins to copy over so we minify workers in prod builds  #6011\r\n - [x] [App] When building a latest build, empty out the `proxy-polyfill` package  #6011\r\n\r\n## Explore\r\n - [ ] [App] ~~Can we move import of `home-assistant-main.ts` out of `home-assistant.ts` to define the `home-assistant` element earlier and start doing work?~~ Since it's 1 JS file it won't benefit.\r\n - [ ] [Rollup] Can we speed up loading with [rollup-plugin-hoist-import-deps](https://github.com/vikerman/rollup-plugin-hoist-import-deps) with `import()` syntax.\r\n - [ ] [Bundlers] Allow marking imports as side effect free to optimize bundling. For Rollup, pass a function to [`treeshake.moduleSideEffects`](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/#treeshake)\r\n - [ ] [Rollup - ES5] Use System.js [named-register extra](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/src/extras/named-register.js) to create a self executing System JS script. Can we turn this into a Rollup plugin?\r\n    ```js\r\n    SystemJSRegisterNamed({\r\n      // Entry per entrypoint name.\r\n      // Each entry will get named after their public path.\r\n      // Value is true or extra options\r\n      core: true,\r\n      app: {\r\n        // If script needs to import itself as last call.\r\n        // System.register(\"frontend_es5/app.js\", …); System.import(\"frontend_es5/app.js\");\r\n        importSelf: true,\r\n        // Inject dependencies on other entrypoints\r\n        addEntrypointDependencies: [\"core\"]\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n    ```\r\n - [x] [App] Can we merge compatibility entry point into core and empty it on latest build? #6029\r\n - [x] [Webpack] Upgrade to Webpack 5 (beta) to see improvements #6200\r\n - [x] [Rollup] ~~Replace terser plugin with [closure-compiler](https://github.com/ampproject/rollup-plugin-closure-compiler/blob/master/README.md)~~ My mac with 16GB runs out of memory when I tried.\r\n\r\n## Finally\r\n- [ ] Remove Webpack packages\r\n- [ ] Remove Webpack ES5 loading logic in HTML templates\r\n- [x] Document build goals and how it works\r\n- [x] Document breaking change: updated minimum requirement to use latest build of the frontend ([old](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module), [new](https://caniuse.com/#feat=es6-module-dynamic-import)).

Since OpenJS World 2022 is already set to take place in Austin next month, it would be good to consider another venue later in the year for a European/International-friendly Collaborator Summit. \r\n\r\nThere has [been some discussion already](https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/archives/CPE10404W/p1651863623548989) about using [NodeConf 2022](https://www.nodeconfremote.com/) (in Kilkenny, Ireland happening October 3-5th) as an event to plan the following summit around (ex. Thursday October 6th & Friday October 7th). This would definitely be a great opportunity for folks that may not be able to attend in-person or virtually in Austin next month for whatever reason. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what would be involved in planning the rental of conference rooms or coordination/collaboration with the NodeConf organizers (/cc @katie-roberts @mcollina) but I wanted to kick-off the discussion to see if there's interest/support.\r\n\r\n/cc @Trott @bnb @ruyadorno @joesepi @qard\r\n\r\n\r\n",

        "body": "I'll leave my final notes about the Social Team: \r\n\r\nI'm disappointed that rather than anyone who was engaging in apparent back-room discussions that were critical of the Social Team trying to engage with the Social Team - either by talking to or working with the team or by actually stepping up to do the work - the decision was made to propose it be removed. I genuinely hope we can try to do better with other teams in the future, as this is a fundamental departure from how we've historically managed _any_ other team as far as I'm aware.\r\n\r\nI stand by my statement earlier that this feels like indirect (intentional or not) validation of one side an unresolved project-level interpersonal issue and a way to avoid actually meaningfully addressing that. We _will_ still need to solve that communication issue - removing the Social Team does not remove the tension, and it will just surface in other unhealthy and dysfunctional ways until it's resolved.\r\n\r\nWith regards to what should be done with the accounts:\r\n\r\nI personally believe that my participation in anything surrounding the project's Social Media will only cause grief and pain - both for myself and for the project.  I am deeply saddened by this, as it's both something I care deeply about and frankly something I feel I did a good job at given the tools and information I had available to me.\r\n\r\nI fundamentally do not object to the proposal given that belief - I encourage it.\r\n\r\nI would _strongly recommend_ that the TSC effectively _lease_ the social media accounts to the OpenJS Foundation rather than handing them over wholesale. More specifically:\r\n\r\n- The TSC should retain the ability to send out their own messages, if they want to and at their discretion.\r\n- The TSC should retain the ability to augment or remove content that is on the project's accounts, if they want to and at their discretion.\r\n- The TSC should retain the ability to allow or disallow certain kinds of content on the project's accounts, if they want to and at their discretion.\r\n- The TSC should retain the ability to reclaim full control of the project's accounts, if they want to and at their discretion.\r\n\r\nI assert the above because, fundamentally, the project's goals and the Foundations goals aren't _necessarily_ always the same - this is intrinsic of an open source project existing under a Foundation, and isn't unique to Node.js. Social Media is a massively impactful tool for both parties in this dynamic, especially with the scale at which the project's accounts exist. We should _not_ lose the ability to have ownership of our voice - this is something that's happened with other similarly impactful projects in other spaces, and their maintainership has _deeply_ regretted it. I want to ensure we never have those regrets.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely reasonable for the project to set boundaries with the Foundation and have them be respected without question, given that it is _our_ voice being used.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed, I hope the above recommendation is taken into consideration and adopted. Feel free to reach out to me directly on Slack, but I'm going to disengage from this thread unless my continued engagement is required.",

Please update your lock file with `npm install` before continuing.\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4664. That issue was closed but there does seem to be an npm bug here.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI haven't thought through the details carefully, but it seems that `b`'s dependency on `c` shouldn't be hoisted if it would result in an invalid optional peer dep.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThis reproduces in npm 8.6.0 through 8.9.0.\r\n\r\n1. Clone https://github.com/billyjanitsch/npm-optional-peer-deps-hoist\r\n2. Note the two separate commits. The [first](https://github.com/billyjanitsch/npm-optional-peer-deps-hoist/commit/6cd5b48f83ff2d7a5f6da31dcf6264abe3d39d4b) commits the package.json, and the [second](https://github.com/billyjanitsch/npm-optional-peer-deps-hoist/commit/4d332d7b525694d3675545556185fce89c664d7c) commits the package-lock.json generated by `npm install`.\r\n3. Run `npm ci` or `npm ls`; both exit with an error.\r\n\r\n`@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin@0.5.5` optionally peer-depends on `type-fest@>=0.17.0 <3.0.0`. `ow` directly depends on `type-fest@^0.11.0`. The latter gets incorrectly hoisted.\n\n### Environment\n\n- npm: 8.9.0\r\n- Node.js: 16.15.0\r\n- OS Name: macOS\r\n- System Model Name: MacBook Pro\r\n- npm config:\r\n```ini\r\n; n/a\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "## Motivation (\"The Why\")\r\n\r\nToday, I wouldn't be surprised if updating packages is more common than installing packages. The `npm install` DX is pretty good, but `npm update` is _sorely_ lacking to the point that we've collectively [built](https://greenkeeper.io/) [a](https://david-dm.org/) [lot](https://github.com/dependabot) [of](https://snyk.io/) [tools](https://depshield.github.io/#/) to try to help.\r\n\r\nIMO the growth of tooling in this space is a result of the lack of _strong_ update management being a norm in the package management tools we rely on at the root. I'd really like to see npm be able to support the average (modern) user's dependency update requirements, rather than those users reach to third-party tooling to achieve good dependency updates.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n- open up any project older than 1 month and try to update dependencies. it's going to be rough. it should be better.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n#### Current Behaviour\r\n- npm update\r\n  - does something but good luck figuring out if your dependencies are _actually_ as up to date as is possible. they're probably not.\r\n \r\n#### Desired Behaviour\r\n- user runs `npm update`\r\n  - npm does a fresh fetch of dependencies *outside* of what's already resolved in node_modules and pacakge-lock.json\r\n    - tell user what modules are different\r\n    - allow `-y` flag for auto-apply\r\n    - let users interactively update dependencies if the `-y` flag is missing\r\n\r\na different way to look at this:\r\n- GitHub Actions workflow runs `npm update -y`\r\n  - set up to automatically PR changes applied to `package.json` if anything changes\r\n  - I should never have to see a Dependabot PR if this workflow were to run and be merged _prior_ to Dependabot being triggered, since `npm update` would have already updated everything.\r\n\r\nyet another way to look at this:\r\n- Dependabot should be _able to_ adopt `npm update` with limited additional configuration to power their JavaScript update tooling.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/555 is similar but not fundamentally the same as this \r\n",
